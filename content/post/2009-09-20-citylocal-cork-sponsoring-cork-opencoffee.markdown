Since Cork OpenCoffee began in early 2007, we've had some intermittent sponsorship of the coffee and scones which has always been appreciated. So we're delighted that Paul Brugger from [Citylocal Cork](http://www.citylocal.ie/cities/Cork/) has agreed to sponsor three of the Rubicon sessions (with the first one just two days ago).

This means no more icky instant coffee and the arrival of the great [Mr Cotton](http://www.mrcotton.com/) coffee instead. By the way, well done to Declan for his appearance on TV3 this week.

[Citylocal](http://www.citylocal.ie/cities/Cork/) is  great resource for local businesses, so the fit with OpenCoffee is perfect. In addition to the paid business listings, you can advertise your properties, post local events and sell items, all for free.

Thanks Paul!
