Cork Open Coffee in association with it@Cork European Tech Cluster is pleased toÂ announce that
Gerry Sweeney will present the next Open Coffee meeting on April the 5th @ 10:30am, at the Rubicon building, CIT.
The title of Jerry Sweeney Cork Open Coffee Speech wil be
"A Game Changing Opportunity for IT in Cork"

Jerry has a particular interest in Cork's fibre optic broadband infrastructure, as you may well know.
In the next few months a new fibre optic cable is to be laid from Dublin to France, passing through Cork.
This would significantly increase Cork's importance as a data storage site, but further local distribution infrastructure would be needed. Mr Denis Collins of IBM / it@Cork will chair the meeting.
Naturally this will create new IT opportunities for Cork.
All interested parties welcome.
