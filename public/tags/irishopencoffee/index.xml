      <description>The guys from Tapasol have built some very interesting bare-metal provisioning and deployment software. I remember looking into this area in EMC a few years back and being disappointed by what was out there.
It&amp;rsquo;s great to see a local company doing something in this space, particularly one that came about due to the Motorola closure. The guys also recently won an award in this years Genesis Programme.
On Friday the 23rd they will talk about the challenges of deploying software on Unix servers and give a demonstration of their automated solution to build a Unix server from bare metal with a single command.</description>

      <title>Phoebe Bright to Demo To-Do App</title>

      <description>The next demo slot on May 9th will have Phoebe Bright presenting her To-Do application. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen an earlier incarnation of this in action and I think it is very competitive to what&amp;rsquo;s out there and has some unique features. In Phoebe&amp;rsquo;s own words:
**Another To Do List Application** This has been my pet project for two years, but stimulated by a conversation at Open Coffee a few weeks ago, I am heading off in a new direction with it and I&amp;rsquo;d love to get some feedback.</description>

      <description>Marie Boran from Silicon Republic has always taken a strong interest in Irish start-up activity. I remember she was the first to get in contact when Paddy&amp;rsquo;s Valley was announced.
She has written a very nice piece in today&amp;rsquo;s Silicon Republic (not sure if it&amp;rsquo;ll be syndicated to Irish Independent or not) about OpenCoffee in Ireland.
You can follow Marie on Twitter here. They&amp;rsquo;ve also enabled a feed of their stories to Twitter here.</description>
