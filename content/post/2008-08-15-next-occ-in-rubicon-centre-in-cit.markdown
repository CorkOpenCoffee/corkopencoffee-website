Well that was a fantastic event today in the NSC. We easily had more than 30 people between OCC regulars and SohoSolo people and some new faces to both.

Thanks again to CorkBIC for hosting and sponsoring.

The networking seemed to work particularly well and I was thrilled to meet some new faces whose products and services were very impressive.

The next OCC is in two weeks on Aug 29th in the Rubicon back to our usual time of 10am.
