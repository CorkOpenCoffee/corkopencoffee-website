Cork Open Coffee is going strong each fortnight but there are a few who can't make it on a Friday morning during work hours.




At the last Open Coffee in Nosh+Coffee it was decided to organise an evening event.




Right now the plan is to meet on **Friday the 28th of August** somewhere in  
  

Cork. 




Are you interested in attended an Open Coffee - evening style? Any  
  

recommendations for a location and a time to kick off?




How about the newly renovated Bodega? Theres plenty of space inside and its  
  

an ideal spot for evening meals, drinks etc.
