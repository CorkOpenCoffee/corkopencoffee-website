      <description>Our first OpenCoffee is Friday 9th in the Rubicon Centre in CIT, this gives us the following dates for the next few months. I&amp;rsquo;ll put these on Upcoming.org too so you can add them to your calendar and auto-monitor for changes.
If you&amp;rsquo;d like to host any of the TBD locations or even replace any Luigi one, just let us know on corkopencoffee AT gmail DOT com
 * 09/01: Location = Rubicon.</description>

      <description>Friday&amp;rsquo;s OpenCoffee was a very lighthearted occasion with 15+ attendees and plenty of technology being passed around. I was pleased to see some new faces too.
A few badly taken pictures:

The next session is in the Rubicon in CIT on Sep 26th from 10-12.</description>

      <description>This week&amp;rsquo;s Cork OpenCoffee is back to our old haunt of Luigi Malones from 10-12 on Friday.
As always with Luigi&amp;rsquo;s, we have no formal demos. However we may have Diarmuid Wrenne and Gordon Murray doing a head2head between their Medion and Asus teeny-tiny laptops. Hopefully we&amp;rsquo;ll broadcast that live on Qik.com. I&amp;rsquo;ll also be showing an early version of LouderVoice for Business if anyone wants a look.
If you have anything you want to show off and would like a mention here on the blog, just drop me a line.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m chuffed to see that Haydn Shaughnessy mentions Cork OpenCoffee in his piece in the Innovation Magazine of today&amp;rsquo;s Irish Times. The point of the article is:
If companies want to be innovative in their field, not only do they need to rethink how they do business, but they also have to be willing to step out of their comfort zone He includes two quotes from me on OpenCoffee which I think are true for many of those who attend.</description>

      <title>Cork OpenCoffee tomorrow in Luigi Malone&#39;s</title>

      <description>Just a quick reminder that OpenCoffee is tomorrow at 10am in Luigi Malone&amp;rsquo;s on Emmet Place.
We&amp;rsquo;ve just heard from Pat Phelan of Cubic Telecom that he&amp;rsquo;ll be doing a demo. Given how busy they have been this week, I&amp;rsquo;ve a feeling this is oneÂ not to miss!
Also, since thisÂ batch of the Genesis programme is coming to a close, it&amp;rsquo;d be great to hear from those who took part in it and hear what they gained from it.</description>
