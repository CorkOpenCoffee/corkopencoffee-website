This morning Tom Doherty from [Beyond Targets](http://www.beyondtargets.com/) spoke to Corks Open Coffee about a concept called The Embedded Entrepreneur. 




Toms talk, directed at Entrepreneurs encouraged those aiming to create a business to put their idea to the test as early as possible. Embed a pre-start entrepreneur in a host customers site for a fixed period of time and only launch a start-up once proof of concept has taken place within a host customer.




It was an excellent presentation and sparked plenty of conversation after the presentation. The slides of the presentation are below, thanks to Tom for sending them on.




Tom also mentioned an initiative he is running in Waterford called ExploreTech where a select number of technical people are brought together to focus on a specific objective. Based on the level of interest he is considering exploring this in Cork.
