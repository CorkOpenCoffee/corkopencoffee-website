Happy New Year to all, hope you are refreshed, revived and full of vigor and enthusiasm for what 2009 has to offer all of us flegling businesses in the Cork area!

The first OCC of 2009 is on this Friday, the 9th January  in the Rubicon Centre in CIT at our usual time of 10am-12pm.

We want to have a brainstorming session for ideas for improvements for the group itself or ideas of events/additions that we can implement in 2009. So have a think over the next few days and come armed with fresh ideas!

If anyone would like to take the demo slot, please leave a comment below.

Looking forward to seeing you all there. As always, OCC is OPEN, so  if you know of any other businesses or individuals who might be interested in coming along, please forward them this post.

See you Friday!

Ciara
