**Hi Occers,**

This weeks Cork Open Coffee is taking place this Friday the 19th at 10am in [The Bodega,](http://www.bodegacork.ie/) Cornmarket street in Cork. No demos this week, just coffee and networking. The Bodega opens at 10am, they have free wifi and a [map on their website](http://www.bodegacork.ie/contact-bodega-pub.aspx) for how to get there.

We have begun using [MailChimp](http://www.mailchimp.com/) to send these email notifications to Cork Open Coffee members. The email list is currently 160 members strong and is growing on a regular basis thanks to existing members recommending the meetings to others, please keep it up! If you know of others that might like to receive the Open Coffee emails, there is a new [Sign-up widget on the blog](/).

In keeping with the 'Open' in Cork Open Coffee, we will be publishing the email campaign stats on the Cork Open Coffee Blog. You can [see the stats from the last email on the blog](/2010/02/10/email-marketing-stats-for-the-%E2%80%98cork-open-coffee-friday-5th-february%E2%80%99-email/) now. No ones email address will be displayed on the blog, just some overview information and hopefully some useful data that might be of interest to members sending their own email marketing campaigns.

If you think you'll be attending, please let us know in the [blog comments](/).

Talk to you all on Friday,

Conor, Ciara & Gordon
