      <description>Last Friday, Cork Open Coffee was invited to the Blackrock Castle Observatory in Blackrock in Cork for coffee and a tour of the facility.
One of our new members, Karl took some excellent photos in and around the castle.
A huge thank you to the hard working people of the Observatory, especially Clair McSweeney who took some time out to give us a 3 hour tour in around 30 minutes.</description>
