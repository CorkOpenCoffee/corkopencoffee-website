Brian McAuliffe from [something.ie](http://something.ie/) is looking for feedback on the soon to be released rev-2 of something.ie and will give a brief demo.  Rev-2 will essentially let anyone create a white labelled social network as easy as creating a blog (or so they say).

It also looks like there is plenty of interest in discussing outsourcing etc. We have several OCC members (including my own company) that outsource design, development and other tasks. There are plenty of pitfalls and it would be fantastic to share lessons learned.
