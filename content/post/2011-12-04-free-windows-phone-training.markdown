Microsoft are doing a full days free training in Cork on December 9th .  Obviously iOS and Android are leading the mobile battle but with Nokia  having adopted Windows Phone, the o/s is going to be a player in the  mobile market.

Nokia, although plummeting, still has the highest market share at just  over 25% compared to Apples share of 3.9%.  [http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/20/nokia-sees-lowest-market-share-in-14-years-gartner/](http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/20/nokia-sees-lowest-market-share-in-14-years-gartner/)

If youâ€™re interested in attending, good idea to bring your laptop for  the hands on labs and have downloaded the at Windows Phone tools SDK in  advance.

Should be a worthwhile day, details and agenda below:
