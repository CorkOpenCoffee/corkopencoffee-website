      <description>The next demo slot on May 9th will have Phoebe Bright presenting her To-Do application. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen an earlier incarnation of this in action and I think it is very competitive to what&amp;rsquo;s out there and has some unique features. In Phoebe&amp;rsquo;s own words:
**Another To Do List Application** This has been my pet project for two years, but stimulated by a conversation at Open Coffee a few weeks ago, I am heading off in a new direction with it and I&amp;rsquo;d love to get some feedback.</description>
