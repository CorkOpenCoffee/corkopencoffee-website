      <description>Hi Occers,
Just before Christmas we experimented with an evening version of Open Coffee we affectionately called &amp;lsquo;After Dark&amp;rsquo;, the name seems to have stuck.
This coming Friday the 26th we&amp;rsquo;re having another After Dark at 8pm in The Bodega, Cornmarket Street in Cork (Map here).
It’s a great opportunity to attend Open Coffee and meet other members who can’t break away during work hours. It’s also a great excuse to grab a beer.</description>

      <description>Cork Open Coffee is going strong each fortnight but there are a few who can&amp;rsquo;t make it on a Friday morning during work hours.
At the last Open Coffee in Nosh+Coffee it was decided to organise an evening event.
Right now the plan is to meet on Friday the 28th of August somewhere in
Cork.
Are you interested in attended an Open Coffee - evening style? Any
recommendations for a location and a time to kick off?</description>
