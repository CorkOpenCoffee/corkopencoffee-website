To get OCC of to an inspiring start in 2012, Stephen Bean, photographer, movie maker, lecturer and media producer for UCC is going to give us a talk on Friday at the Rubicon, CIT. Come along any time after 10 for coffee and the talk will start at 10:30. 

More about Stephen here: and photography at UCC here: https://www.facebook.com/pages/New-Photography-at-UCC/143207142438614 . Stephen has an astonishing breadth of experience from war photography to photographing silver tea pots (do you know how hard that is?!) to filming interviews and caves so bring along you image media questions for him. Look forward to seeing you on Friday.
