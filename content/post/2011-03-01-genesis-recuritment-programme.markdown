Genesis – Turning Ideas into Real Business
CIT now recruiting for 2011 Genesis Enterprise Programme

How do you turn your idea into a real business? When it comes to  starting or expanding your business, it’s usually not the idea that  fails but the execution that wins. To survive and win in today’s global  markets, Irish start-ups need to be expert not just in the idea or  product but also in designing and executing the business around the  idea. The highly successful Genesis Enterprise Programme helps  entrepreneurs develop their ideas into real exporting businesses.  Genesis is now recruiting entrepreneurs for its new 2011/12 programme  commencing in May 2011.

Now in its 14th year, Genesis has a proven track record in helping  over 180 entrepreneurs get their businesses off the ground.  And, the  real measure of its success is that more than 70% of the start-up  businesses who emerged from the Genesis programme are in operation five  years on, employing well over 1,200 people in the South West of Ireland.   At a time when exports have never been so important to the future of  our economy, over 50% of the businesses emerging from Genesis are  selling to customers in international markets. Many have become  Enterprise Ireland “High Potential Start-Ups” and raised significant  angel and venture capital investment.

Putting the Programme into real terms, some well-known businesses  that started life in Genesis include Abtran, Crest Solutions, Cully  & Sully, Comnitel/IBM, Eolas International, Ferfics, Radisen  Diagnostics, Treemetrics, Weddingdates.ie, and Wavebreak Media. The  emphasis of Genesis has always been to support high value, knowledge  based Irish owned businesses, which have the potential to scale into  export markets and create employment in Ireland. Genesis works with  start-ups across a diversity of sectors including energy and  environmental, food, photonics, information technology, mechanical  engineering, medical devices, biotechnology, media and internationally  traded services.

So how does it work?  Genesis is a 12-month, full time, rapid  incubation programme that provides a comprehensive range of supports to  innovative start-ups to help them establish their business successfully  in a planned and focused environment.  Over the duration of the  programme they will be presented with the practical skills, expertise,  contact networks and tools necessary to develop an idea into a solid  real business.

Participants learn through seminars, workshops, clinics, mentoring  and peer learning meetings. Business milestones are set for their  development and their progress is guided by a dedicated Programme  Manager, Denise Kennedy, and the experienced Rubicon team and its wider  network of experts, as well as ready access to the programme partners  including Cork Institute of Technology, Enterprise Ireland and the Cork  City & County Enterprise Boards. Along the way, they learn how talk  to the market, raise investment capital and launch their product/service  in the marketplace. Information and access to sources of business  funding is one of the most critical areas that Genesis works with  start-ups on. Participants can work at their own location or take  advantage of free office facilities in the Rubicon Centre, Ireland’s  largest incubation centre, embedded on campus in the Cork Institute of  Technology.

The work of the Genesis Enterprise Programme and Cork Institute of  Technology in developing entrepreneurs in Ireland was recognised in the  EU's European Enterprise Awards 2010 in Madrid. Genesis won an award for  best practice in enterprise development from a field of over 300  projects across 28 countries.

Genesis attributes its success in enabling the emergence of new  companies to its significant experience gained from a 14 year history of  working with start ups and the rich entrepreneurial environment that  has grown up around the programme. Genesis participants can leverage and  learn from the network of past participants operating both in the  Rubicon Centre and beyond in the South West region, the practical  expertise of one-to-one clinics and mentors and  to the resources of the  programme partners in Cork Institute of Technology, Enterprise Ireland  and the Cork City & County Enterprise Boards.

If you want to gain the commercial advantage that Genesis offers for  your business start up, applications for the upcoming 2011/2012 Genesis  Enterprise Programme can be made online by visiting www.gep.ie. The  closing date for applications is Friday 8th April 2011 with the new  programme commencing in May.
