This week’s Cork Open Coffee will take place on Friday from 10am in a new venue, **Nosh + Coffee in the Mardyke Arena in  Cork**. There are no talks or presentation planned this week, just  open networking and coffee.

The owners, Simon and his wife Jackie have generously invited  Cork Open Coffee members to meet in their café, where we will all receive a **complimentary coffee on arrival**. And there's Wifi too!

For anyone staying around for lunch, Simon has also generously  offered 10% off their lunch menu.

There is parking available in the area with 2 hours free  (maybe more) with a cost of 5 Euro per hour after that.

If you are unfamiliar with the area, here is [a map to the  Maradyke Arena, Cork](http://www.mardykearena.com/directionsandmaps.cfm).

**Open Coffee - After Dark**

For those who would like to attend but can't make Cork Open Coffee during the working hours, there is 'After Dark'. A monthly Open Coffee which takes place on the last Friday of the month.

This months After Dark takes place in The Bodega from 8pm. We usually try to take over the little cubbyhole section just inside the door to the left of the bar so look for us there.

**Want to talk at Open  Coffee?**

If you would like to make a presentation, to demo a new app  or get some feedback at an upcoming Cork Open Coffee, please get in touch by  responding to this email or contacting myself, Ciara Crossan or Conor O’Neill  directly.

Talk to you all on Friday,
