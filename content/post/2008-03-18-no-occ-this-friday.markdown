Just a quick note to say that there will be no OCC this Friday since we had a very small turnout on the same day last year. Next one will therefore be Fri 28th in the Rubicon. The demo slot has been filled and I'll send on details of that closer to the time.

We need to decide where the next one will be after that (on April 11th). Both NSC and Webworks were very successful but if people would like a re-visit to Luigi's, that is an option too. Please let me know your preference or suggestions for other locations.
