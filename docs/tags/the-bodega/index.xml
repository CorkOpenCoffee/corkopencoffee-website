      <description>Hi Occers,
Just before Christmas we experimented with an evening version of Open Coffee we affectionately called &amp;lsquo;After Dark&amp;rsquo;, the name seems to have stuck.
This coming Friday the 26th we&amp;rsquo;re having another After Dark at 8pm in The Bodega, Cornmarket Street in Cork (Map here).
It’s a great opportunity to attend Open Coffee and meet other members who can’t break away during work hours. It’s also a great excuse to grab a beer.</description>
