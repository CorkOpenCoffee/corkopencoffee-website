      <description>The next Cork OCC is on this Friday in the board room of the NSC in Mahon. It is a bit different from our normal get-together for two reasons. The first is that it starts at 9am instead of the usual 10. The second is that it&amp;rsquo;s a joint event with SohoSolo. This means we&amp;rsquo;ll have a bigger group that usual. There won&amp;rsquo;t be a formal demo but we will hear a short intro about SohoSolo and the other services of CorkBIC who have been strong supporters of OpenCoffee since it started.</description>
