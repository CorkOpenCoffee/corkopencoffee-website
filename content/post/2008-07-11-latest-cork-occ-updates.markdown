Just a few notes on the latest from Cork OpenCoffee.



	  * We're in today's Examiner! Half page piece including a picture I took at the Tapasol Demo in the Rubicon Boardroom.
	  * Aileen Cussen wants to thank everyone who donated last Friday. She raised almost â‚¬700 from a total of â‚¬4000. In addition, she got multiple offers of help and expertise for the trip to Uganda including Wifi/internet guidance, laptop configuration, CD burning and local contacts. I'll write more on this over the weekend in the context of the power of the network. An extra big thanks to Margaret in the Rubicon for rounding up lots of people on the morning.
	  * Next OCC is probably in NSC in Mahon next Friday 18th. Details TBC shortly
	  * OpenCoffee BBQ is on next Wednesday in Terryglass. We're carpooling from Cork with cars currently planning to leave Cork at 9.30 and returning pretty early (4ish). If you haven't already contacted me about getting transport (bus or car) please do ASAP. If you have, then I'll be mailing the carpooling details shortly.
