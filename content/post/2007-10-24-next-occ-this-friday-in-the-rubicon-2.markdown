Our regular meet-up in the Rubicon is on again at 10am this Friday. Despite  the Bank Holiday, we thought we would go ahead as usual. A few items which you  may wish to discuss:



	  * The [MashupCamp    event](http://www.web2ireland.org/2007/10/22/mashupcamp-great-speaker-line-up/) is coming to Dublin on Nov 10-12th. If you are involved in web    development, this could be very interesting for you.

	  * I have been given several free tickets (worth over â‚¬1000 each) to the [Web2Expo Event](http://berlin.web2expo.com/) in Berlin from Nov    5th-8th. If you would like one and can definitely attend, let me know by    e-mail or on Friday.
	  * Enterprise Ireland is once again processing "new company cert"    applications via the employment grant mechanism. Having this cert is a    pre-requisite for getting approved for BES. Contact your EI DA or CEB for more    details. Both Aileen Cussen and Martin Corkery would be happy to answer your questions for EI.

	  * The [it@cork](mailto:it@cork) awards are on Nov 1st. Well done    to Cork OCC regulars Cubic Telecom for [making    the finals](http://blog.itcork.ie/finalists-in-two-awards-catgories-announced/) of the Emerging Company Award.
