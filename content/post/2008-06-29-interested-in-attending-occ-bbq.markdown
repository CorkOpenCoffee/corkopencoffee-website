As many of you know, Evert Bopp is organising [OpenCoffeeClub BBQ](http://opencoffeeclub-bbq.com/) in Terryglass in  Tipperary on Wednesday July 16th. It sounds like there are quite a few from Cork  OpenCoffee interested in attending. If you are one of them (and I need  definites), would you be interested in sharing the cost of a mini-bus to take us  up and down? Please e-mail conor AT loudervoice DOT com if you are.

The day sounds excellent with over 70 confirmed attendees and 11 talks. Like  OpenCoffee, it's an informal gathering of entrepreneurs, start-ups, investors,  EI/CEBsÂ and anybody with an interest in business and technology who want to  tell their story, network, do deals and learn from each other.

There willÂ beÂ a "Dragon's Den" section where they want to give  startups or entrepreneurs the chance to present themselves and their ideas.  AÂ panel will choose the best entry (or entries) and these will be awarded  prizes that will help them to get their venture of the ground.

Of course there will be BBQ and beverages!

The event is free for all attendees and Evert will ensure full Wifi coverage  for the day.

He is still looking for sponsors, particularly in the Finance space for the  Dragon's Den segment. Please contact him directly on [contactevert@gmail.com](mailto:contactevert@gmail.com) or 087 6324042  if you wish to sponsor any aspect of the day.

Hope to see you there.
