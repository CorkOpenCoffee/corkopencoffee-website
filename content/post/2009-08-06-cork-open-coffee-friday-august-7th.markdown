This weeks Cork Open Coffee is back in Nosh + Coffee, on Careys Lane, near Paul Street Shopping Centre.

    **Friday 7th August 10am - 12pm.**

No formal demos, just open networking and idea-sharing as always.

Hope to see you all there tomorrow and feel free to bring any friends or other interested parties
