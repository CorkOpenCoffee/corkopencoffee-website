# Cork OpenCoffee Archive Site
This site is a static archive of all the blogposts from August 2007 until March 2014 when it was shut down. Conor Oâ€™Neill, the original organiser of OCC, setup this archive in September 2021 for posterity.

You can find some other posts about OCC, particularly the initial announcement etc, over on the Argolon Blog.

Please contact Conor if you have any questions about the site or if you have access to the original images we used here.
