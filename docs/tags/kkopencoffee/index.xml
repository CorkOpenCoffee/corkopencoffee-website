      <description>Delighted to hear that the KK crew are finally having an OpenCoffee at 11.30 this morning in the Kilkenny Cafe located downstairs in Market Cross Shopping Centre.
They join Cork, Limerick, Dublin, Waterford, Belfast and Galway as an OCC location. If you are based anywhere in the South-East, it’ll be worth checking out. Hopefully they’ll have attendees from Wexford, Waterford, Carlow, Tipperary, Offaly etc.</description>
