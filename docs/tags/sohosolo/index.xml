      <description>Monday&amp;rsquo;s special OCC in the NSC was exactly that, special. The boardroom was jammed full of people, many of them new faces to hear Tom Keane talk about Nitrosell, his history and his advice on growing a business. I was completely riveted by what he had to say since so much of it applied directly to what we are doing in LouderVoice. The questions at the end told me that he had affected many of the attendees in the same way.</description>

      <description>The next Cork OCC is on this Friday in the board room of the NSC in Mahon. It is a bit different from our normal get-together for two reasons. The first is that it starts at 9am instead of the usual 10. The second is that it&amp;rsquo;s a joint event with SohoSolo. This means we&amp;rsquo;ll have a bigger group that usual. There won&amp;rsquo;t be a formal demo but we will hear a short intro about SohoSolo and the other services of CorkBIC who have been strong supporters of OpenCoffee since it started.</description>
