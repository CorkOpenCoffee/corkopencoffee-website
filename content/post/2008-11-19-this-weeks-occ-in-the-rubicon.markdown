Hello Cork OpenCoffee!

As was announced previously by Conor, myself and Gordon are now sharing the load of coordinating the OCC events.  As someone who has benefitted greatly from OpenCoffee in the few months I have been attending, I was delighted to be asked to get more involved and help out a bit more.

The beauty of OpenCoffee is just that, its openness; however I will endeavour to follow the format that Conor has adopted and do a quick round-the-table (we're talking 30 seconds here guys!) and then open it up to a demo and Q&A and then general networking and sharing of ideas.

The next OCC is on this Friday in the Rubicon Centre in CIT at our usual time of 10am-12.  If anyone would like to take the demo slot, please leave a comment.  If not, I will take the opportunity to showcase my site [weddingdates.ie](http://weddingdates.ie/) which launched a month ago and would be delighted to hear all your feedback.

Looking forward to seeing you all there.  Also - if you know of any other businesses or individuals who might be interested in coming along, please invite them to come along - the more the merrier!

Many thanks,
Ciara Crossan
