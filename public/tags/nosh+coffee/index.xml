      <description>This week’s Cork Open Coffee will take place on Friday from 10am in a new venue, Nosh + Coffee in the Mardyke Arena in Cork. There are no talks or presentation planned this week, just open networking and coffee.
The owners, Simon and his wife Jackie have generously invited Cork Open Coffee members to meet in their café, where we will all receive a complimentary coffee on arrival. And there&amp;rsquo;s Wifi too!</description>
