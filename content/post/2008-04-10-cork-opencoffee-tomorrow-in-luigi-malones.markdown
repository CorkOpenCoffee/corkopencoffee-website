Just a quick reminder that OpenCoffee is tomorrow at 10am in [Luigi Malone's](http://useamap.com/opencoffeecork) on Emmet Place.

We've just heard from Pat Phelan of Cubic Telecom that he'll be doing a demo.  Given how busy they have been this week, I've a feeling this is oneÂ not to  miss!

Also, since thisÂ batch of the Genesis programme is coming to a close,  it'd be great to hear from those who took part in it and hear what they gained  from it.

If you are new to OCC, just look for the people with laptops, Nokia N95s,  iPhones and Asus EeePCs :-)
