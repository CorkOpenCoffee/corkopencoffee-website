Tomorrow's open coffee will be in Luigi Malones, opposite the Opera House in Cork.Â  There is no one scheduled for an official demo but with the Blog Awards being hosted in the Rebel County this weekend we will be delighted to hopefully welcome a few new blogger faces to Open Coffee.

See you all there!
