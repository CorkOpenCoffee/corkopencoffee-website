At some point every start-up will need documents to be written such as a Requirements document or a Business plan to explain their ideas to developers and investors.


Google may be a first port of call. It will provide you with many useful avenues to explore. As Open Coffee members I feel we have a great opportunity to collaborate to make solid and well rounded guidelines for anyone to use to promote their own ideas.




Any input from those of you who have business plans that served you well in the past is especially appreciated.




The best way I can think to do this is to start off with two documents using Google Docs. To be added as collaborators to the documents, please email me at gordon at ewrite dot ie.
