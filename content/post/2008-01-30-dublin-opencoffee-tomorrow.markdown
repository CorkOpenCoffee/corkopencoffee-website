Just a reminder that there are regular OCC meetups in Limerick, Dublin, Waterford, Belfast and Galway if you are ever there on a day they are happening.

The Dublin one is tomorrow (Thursday 31st Jan) in the Morrison Hotel at 9am. I have to say I love that venue. Bright and airy, with really friendly staff, good coffee and free Wifi. There is parking just around the corner (or try Arnotts or Jervis Street). Last time I came up from Cork for a meeting there, I shot the old way into town via Inchicore and Con Colbert Road, past Heuston, down the river and turned just at the Morrison itself which is before Ha'penny Bridge.

[The bawld Paul Walsh](http://paulfwalsh.com/will-i-see-you-at-opencoffee-dublin/) from Segala will be there tomorrow and he is hoping to see those from the investment community and Enterprise Ireland attend. Hopefully we'll see some [Qik](http://qik.com/) coverage of the proceedings, particularly if anyone has stuff to demo.

[Bernie](http://irish.typepad.com/) and crew in IT Tipp are building out opencoffee.ie and Eoghan has recently launched the [Dublin OCC site](http://www.opencoffeedublin.com/), so lots happening in the world of OCC in Ireland.
