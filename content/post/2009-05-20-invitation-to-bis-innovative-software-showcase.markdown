Just got this from Brian O'Flaherty in UCC:


<blockquote>On  May 26th, the BIS Innovative Software Showcase presents the entrepreneurial endeavours of  eleven companies from the MBS BIS Programme.

Come and meet the entrepreneurs, their mentors and University staff at this prestigious showcase, which will be followed by an awards presentation.

A panel of external judges will evaluate the projects  beforehand and award the BIS Innovation Prize which is kindly sponsored by Cork City Enterprise Board.

Do you have a good eye for technology business trends? Can you spot value and winners? Do you have confidence in the ability of young people to unearth innovation?

Tuesday 26th May 2009, 4:30pm â€“ 6.30pm in Aula Maxima, North Wing, UCC.

Parking is available at Perrott Avenue (In front of Hayfield Manor Hotel) and Perrott Inch car parks (Near Gaol Cross.)

Further details and Brochure [is available here](http://bof.ucc.ie/boflaherty/MBSBISShowcase2009.htm).</blockquote>
