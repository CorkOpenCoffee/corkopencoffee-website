I've arranged a dinner for this coming  Tuesday night in Cork City (final venue decision imminent). It is to wish fond  farewell to OpenCoffee stalwart [Tom Raftery](http://tomrafteryit.net/) who is moving to Spain with his  family.

If you would like to attend, please let me know by e-mail to conor AT loudervoice DOT com by Saturday  night at the latest. It should be a great night.
