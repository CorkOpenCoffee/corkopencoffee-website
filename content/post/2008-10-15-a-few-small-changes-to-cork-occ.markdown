Based on feedback from attendees we're making two small changes to the way we do things at OpenCoffee.Â 

The first concerns the round-table introductions which many feel are taking up far too much time. So from Oct 24th onwards you have 30 seconds or less to introduce yourself. I recommend three sentences: [1] Your name and your company name [2] What you do (one sentence!) [3] Your current challenge in your business.

It is generally felt that I am being too easy-going with keeping things tight time-wise so we'll be doing a hard cut-off on people from now on. The same applies to demos. 15 minutes **max** presentation followed by 5 mins Q&A. If people wish to continue discussing the demo, they can of course keep doing so, just not with the whole group involved.

The second issue is to do with Luigi Malone's where they are now insisting we pay as a group rather than individually. Can you all please make sure to leave enough money on the table to cover your coffee/scone etc as soon as you order it. Some of the OCCers have very kindly covered our shortfall on a few occasions.
