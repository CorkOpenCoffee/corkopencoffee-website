After such a great turnout at the last one, I hope we have even more new faces this week. Unfortunately I probably won't be able to make it as I'll be coming back from the DemoBar event in Dublin. If I catch an early enough train I may make part of the session.
I have received no update on BES/SCS. If anyone else has, please share it with the group. On Will Knott's suggestion, I contacted Cillian Byrnes in the Revenue Commissioners regarding the possibility of him doing interviews which would capture all the important details of both schemes. He is currently on vacation and will get back to me on his return.

I would encourage all the OCCers to subscribe to the RSS feed or via the Feedburner mail option in the right-hand sidebar. I won't be doing mail-shots after today's one as I know some of you find them intrusive. Right now there are only 8 people RSS subscribed and 1 via email.

Declan and Diarmuid kindly covered the refreshments at the last OCC. Paul Healy has kindly offered to take care of the cost of the coffee which is excellent news. Thanks Paul! If people are eager for scones we can lob a euro or so each into a cup to cover the cost and have someone different volunteer to get them for each session?
