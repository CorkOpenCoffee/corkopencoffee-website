**Hi Occers,**

This weeks Cork Open Coffee is taking place this Friday the 5th at 10am in [The Rubicon Centre](http://www.rubiconcentre.ie) in Bishopstown in Cork.

Phoebe Bright from [Jumpstart Cork](http://jumpstartcork.com) will be giving a quick talk and hoping for some feedback on the concept of profit-share as a payment method for work for businesses. There is time for a second talk if there is anoyne that would like to present something new to memebers for some feedback.

Cork Open Coffee is also looking for any businesses that might like to Sponsor some future Open Coffee events, this means for a small amount we'd be able to get in some Coffee and nibbles from local businesses. [Paul Brugger from CityLocal Cork](http://www.citylocal.ie/cork/) was good enough to sponser Open Coffee for a few weeks before Christmas.

In keeping with the 'Open' in Cork Open Coffee, we are publishing the email campaign stats on the Cork Open Coffee Blog. You can see the [stats from the last few emails](/category/email-marketing/) on the blog now. No ones email address will be displayed on the blog, just some overview information and hopefully some useful data that might be of interest to members sending their own email marketing campaigns.

If you think you'll be attending, please let us know in the blog comments.

Talk to you all on Friday,

Conor, Ciara & Gordon
Cork Open Coffee Organisers.
