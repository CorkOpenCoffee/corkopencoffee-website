**Hi Occers,**

This weeks Cork Open Coffee is taking place this Friday the 14th at 10am in [The Rubicon Centre](http://www.rubiconcentre.ie) in Bishopstown in Cork ([Map](http://rubiconcentre.ie/index.php/contact-us)).

There are no demos or talks lined up this week. If you have a new site or app that you'd like to show off and get some feedback on, get in touch.

[Bizcamp Dublin](http://www.bizcamp.ie/dublin/) takes place on May 29th in the Guinness Storehouse.   BizCamp is an opportunity for entrepreneurs and innovators to come together, share experiences, and possibly create something new. Definitely worth a trip.

Cork Open Coffee is also looking for any businesses that might like  to Sponsor some future Open Coffee events, this means for a small  amount we'd be able to get in some Coffee and nibbles from local  businesses, especially [Mr. Cotton Coffee](http://www.mrcotton.com/).

Talk to you all on Friday,

Don't forget to follow [@corkopencoffee](http://twitter.com/corkopencoffee) on Twitter!
