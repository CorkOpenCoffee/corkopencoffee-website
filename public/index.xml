      <description>Microsoft are doing a full days free training in Cork on December 9th . Obviously iOS and Android are leading the mobile battle but with Nokia having adopted Windows Phone, the o/s is going to be a player in the mobile market.
Nokia, although plummeting, still has the highest market share at just over 25% compared to Apples share of 3.9%. http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/20/nokia-sees-lowest-market-share-in-14-years-gartner/
If you’re interested in attending, good idea to bring your laptop for the hands on labs and have downloaded the at Windows Phone tools SDK in advance.</description>

      <description>This morning, Open Coffee took place in the Rubicon center from 10am til 12pm.
The topic of the morning was Cork Open Coffee itself, to see if any members would like to make any changes to how OCC has been working over the past 2 years or so.
There was some great feedback and I took plenty of notes while we all talked. Thank you everyone for all the feedback.</description>

      <description>Hi Occers,
Just before Christmas we experimented with an evening version of Open Coffee we affectionately called &amp;lsquo;After Dark&amp;rsquo;, the name seems to have stuck.
This coming Friday the 26th we&amp;rsquo;re having another After Dark at 8pm in The Bodega, Cornmarket Street in Cork (Map here).
It’s a great opportunity to attend Open Coffee and meet other members who can’t break away during work hours. It’s also a great excuse to grab a beer.</description>

      <description>Since Cork OpenCoffee began in early 2007, we&amp;rsquo;ve had some intermittent sponsorship of the coffee and scones which has always been appreciated. So we&amp;rsquo;re delighted that Paul Brugger from Citylocal Cork has agreed to sponsor three of the Rubicon sessions (with the first one just two days ago).

This means no more icky instant coffee and the arrival of the great Mr Cotton coffee instead. By the way, well done to Declan for his appearance on TV3 this week.</description>

At the last Open Coffee in Nosh+Coffee it was decided to organise an evening event.
Right now the plan is to meet on Friday the 28th of August somewhere in
Cork.
Are you interested in attended an Open Coffee - evening style? Any
recommendations for a location and a time to kick off?</description>

      <description>Happy New Year to all, hope you are refreshed, revived and full of vigor and enthusiasm for what 2009 has to offer all of us flegling businesses in the Cork area!
The first OCC of 2009 is on this Friday, the 9th January in the Rubicon Centre in CIT at our usual time of 10am-12pm.
We want to have a brainstorming session for ideas for improvements for the group itself or ideas of events/additions that we can implement in 2009.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve just had a fantastic 2008 in OCC and I think we can make it even better in 2009. A few quick thoughts as we race towards the end of the year.
 OCC only works because of the attendees. Thanks to everyone who even attended one session this year. Ciara and Gordon are doing a fantastic job re-invigorating OCC. I should have asked for their help earlier! I&amp;rsquo;ll post at least three months of dates for 2009 shortly.</description>

      <description>Hello Cork OpenCoffee!
As was announced previously by Conor, myself and Gordon are now sharing the load of coordinating the OCC events. As someone who has benefitted greatly from OpenCoffee in the few months I have been attending, I was delighted to be asked to get more involved and help out a bit more.
The beauty of OpenCoffee is just that, its openness; however I will endeavour to follow the format that Conor has adopted and do a quick round-the-table (we&amp;rsquo;re talking 30 seconds here guys!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d very happy to announce that the organisation of each Cork OpenCoffee session will be split between me, Gordon Murray and Ciara Crossan from now on. I really appreciate them both agreeing to help out and each of us will organise every third event.
You&amp;rsquo;ll see no major difference in OCC except that the person deciding the demos, doing the intros and sending the reminder emails will rotate.
To kick if off, Gordon will be arranging this Friday.</description>

      <description>Tricia and David from Nomos Software demoed their software on Friday. Whilst it was a highly technical topic, we had an excellent QA session about the business side of things. From their own site: &amp;ldquo;Nomos Software applies model driven engineering, code generation and declarative rules-based techniques to the management and control of data&amp;rdquo;.

This was the first OCC session where we aimed for tight time control and it worked very well.</description>

      <title>A Few Small Changes to Cork OCC</title>

      <guid>https://localhost/2008/10/15/a-few-small-changes-to-cork-occ/</guid>
      <description>Based on feedback from attendees we&amp;rsquo;re making two small changes to the way we do things at OpenCoffee. The first concerns the round-table introductions which many feel are taking up far too much time. So from Oct 24th onwards you have 30 seconds or less to introduce yourself. I recommend three sentences: [1] Your name and your company name [2] What you do (one sentence!) [3] Your current challenge in your business.</description>

      <description>Monday&amp;rsquo;s special OCC in the NSC was exactly that, special. The boardroom was jammed full of people, many of them new faces to hear Tom Keane talk about Nitrosell, his history and his advice on growing a business. I was completely riveted by what he had to say since so much of it applied directly to what we are doing in LouderVoice. The questions at the end told me that he had affected many of the attendees in the same way.</description>

      <description>TheÂ it@cork annual conference has just been announced. Its title is &amp;ldquo;GREEN IT: Reduce CO2, Raise Profits&amp;rdquo; and it&amp;rsquo;s on November 26 in the lovely Radisson SAS Hotel in Cork.
The line-up looks like an excellent mix with the focus being clearly on Green as it relates to IT and Business. I particularly like the profit angle given the turmoil the world is going through right now
The is an Early Bird Discount available - Book on or before October 31 and it&amp;rsquo;s €250 for members, €350 for non members.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re running a special one-off OpenCoffee this coming Monday (13th) instead of the usual Friday. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit unusual in that we&amp;rsquo;ve invited a speaker to come in and talk about how he grew his business and raised funding. That person is Tom Keane, President of Nitrosell. He has a long history in the software biz and I know I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one who has a ton of questions to ask him.</description>

We have a strong vision for this event and we need your help to make it happen on the day. Please read the first set of posts and give us your feedback.</description>

      <description>The next OCC is today in the Rubicon Centre in CITÂ at our usual time of 10am-12. We&amp;rsquo;ll have one informal demo from a new attendee.
I was also contacted by Brian O&amp;rsquo;Flaherty from UCC who will be there. The directors of the Masters in Business Information Systems (MBIS) programme at UCC are looking to work with Cork companies in the development of products and services for business.

      <description>Friday&amp;rsquo;s OpenCoffee was a very lighthearted occasion with 15+ attendees and plenty of technology being passed around. I was pleased to see some new faces too.
A few badly taken pictures:

      <description>This week&amp;rsquo;s Cork OpenCoffee is back to our old haunt of Luigi Malones from 10-12 on Friday.
As always with Luigi&amp;rsquo;s, we have no formal demos. However we may have Diarmuid Wrenne and Gordon Murray doing a head2head between their Medion and Asus teeny-tiny laptops. Hopefully we&amp;rsquo;ll broadcast that live on Qik.com. I&amp;rsquo;ll also be showing an early version of LouderVoice for Business if anyone wants a look.
If you have anything you want to show off and would like a mention here on the blog, just drop me a line.</description>

      <description>Well that was a fantastic event today in the NSC. We easily had more than 30 people between OCC regulars and SohoSolo people and some new faces to both.
Thanks again to CorkBIC for hosting and sponsoring.
The networking seemed to work particularly well and I was thrilled to meet some new faces whose products and services were very impressive.
The next OCC is in two weeks on Aug 29th in the Rubicon back to our usual time of 10am.</description>

      <description>The next Cork OCC is on this Friday in the board room of the NSC in Mahon. It is a bit different from our normal get-together for two reasons. The first is that it starts at 9am instead of the usual 10. The second is that it&amp;rsquo;s a joint event with SohoSolo. This means we&amp;rsquo;ll have a bigger group that usual. There won&amp;rsquo;t be a formal demo but we will hear a short intro about SohoSolo and the other services of CorkBIC who have been strong supporters of OpenCoffee since it started.</description>

      <description>Given the interest expressed in having a SeedCamp prep session, Gordon Murray has arrangedÂ a room in Oriel House Hotel in Ballincollig, Cork for Thursday August 7th starting at around 9am.
It will be quite informal, the aim is to get practical advice from each other on answering some of the questions on the application form so that you promote your business or idea as best as possible.
Heâ€™ll have printouts of the questions with him on the day.</description>

Wow. There are now over 80 of you all round the world (see [www.opencoffeeclub.org](http://www.opencoffeeclub.org/)) - its pretty amazing how its spread over the last year and we have new locations starting every month.</description>

      <description>The is a re-post from Web2Ireland:
Gordon Murray of eWrite has come up with a brilliant suggestion for SeedCamp. He thinks we should crowdsource some of the applications. There are plenty of people who have experience in filling out application forms for the likes of Incubation Programmes, EI Grants, the SeedCorn competition etc. Why not use that expertise to help those applying to SeedCamp who may never have dealt with this sort of thing before?</description>

      <description>The next OCC would normally not be in the Rubicon but we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to have a special joint-one there this coming Friday, July 4th at 10am.
Aileen Cussen, who is an EI D.A. to many of you I&amp;rsquo;m sure (including ourselves) is going to Uganda to help build a school and educate some of the local children for a period of several weeks. It is being done as part of the Lake Lyantonde project which was initiated by the Kabata Farmers Group and run by the local community with an aim of creating awareness of, environmental conservation practices, safe water and sanitation, sustainable agriculture, HIV/Aids, and fostering general development for the community living near Lake Lyantonde.</description>

The Demo Slot on the 20th will have Paul Harrington show us MapEnable.</description>

      <description>Our second last OpenCoffee was in Luigi Malone&amp;rsquo;s where Pat Phelan, from Cubic Telecom, demoed TwitterFone to us all. We were all sworn to secrecy until the official launch which happened last night. The response, as we all predicted, has been overwhelming.
Apart from the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s a fabulous service, there are some strong lessons to be learned from the TwitterFone development.
 * Do it, do it, do it do it.</description>

      <description>The guys from Tapasol have built some very interesting bare-metal provisioning and deployment software. I remember looking into this area in EMC a few years back and being disappointed by what was out there.
It&amp;rsquo;s great to see a local company doing something in this space, particularly one that came about due to the Motorola closure. The guys also recently won an award in this years Genesis Programme.
On Friday the 23rd they will talk about the challenges of deploying software on Unix servers and give a demonstration of their automated solution to build a Unix server from bare metal with a single command.</description>

      <description>The next demo slot on May 9th will have Phoebe Bright presenting her To-Do application. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen an earlier incarnation of this in action and I think it is very competitive to what&amp;rsquo;s out there and has some unique features. In Phoebe&amp;rsquo;s own words:
**Another To Do List Application** This has been my pet project for two years, but stimulated by a conversation at Open Coffee a few weeks ago, I am heading off in a new direction with it and I&amp;rsquo;d love to get some feedback.</description>

      <description>Marie Boran from Silicon Republic has always taken a strong interest in Irish start-up activity. I remember she was the first to get in contact when Paddy&amp;rsquo;s Valley was announced.
She has written a very nice piece in today&amp;rsquo;s Silicon Republic (not sure if it&amp;rsquo;ll be syndicated to Irish Independent or not) about OpenCoffee in Ireland.
You can follow Marie on Twitter here. They&amp;rsquo;ve also enabled a feed of their stories to Twitter here.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m chuffed to see that Haydn Shaughnessy mentions Cork OpenCoffee in his piece in the Innovation Magazine of today&amp;rsquo;s Irish Times. The point of the article is:
If companies want to be innovative in their field, not only do they need to rethink how they do business, but they also have to be willing to step out of their comfort zone He includes two quotes from me on OpenCoffee which I think are true for many of those who attend.</description>

      <description>Just a quick reminder that OpenCoffee is tomorrow at 10am in Luigi Malone&amp;rsquo;s on Emmet Place.
We&amp;rsquo;ve just heard from Pat Phelan of Cubic Telecom that he&amp;rsquo;ll be doing a demo. Given how busy they have been this week, I&amp;rsquo;ve a feeling this is oneÂ not to miss!
Also, since thisÂ batch of the Genesis programme is coming to a close, it&amp;rsquo;d be great to hear from those who took part in it and hear what they gained from it.</description>

      <description>What started as a discussion about having an OpenCoffee in the Midlands the other day quickly turned into a proposal for an OpenBBQ in Terryglass on Lough Derg this summer.
Think business networking, free Wifi, top class BBQ and fun.
Evert has all the details so far. Please drop him a line if you think you might go. He&amp;rsquo;s thinking June/July mid-week. If there is enough interest from Cork OpenCoffee we could consider hiring a mini-bus?</description>

      <description>This is my second time to write this post as the first one got deleted accidentally. We had a particularly good OCC meet-up last Friday in the Rubicon with four new faces. The round table introductions caused so many spin-off conversations that we ended up not doing anything else!
A welcome then to:
 * Bob Gee of [Connect Promotions](http://www.connectpro.ie/) who seemed delighted by the response of us all to his business (promotional items or schwag as we geeks call it).</description>

      <description>Just a quick note to say that there will be no OCC this Friday since we had a very small turnout on the same day last year. Next one will therefore be Fri 28th in the Rubicon. The demo slot has been filled and I&amp;rsquo;ll send on details of that closer to the time.
We need to decide where the next one will be after that (on April 11th). Both NSC and Webworks were very successful but if people would like a re-visit to Luigi&amp;rsquo;s, that is an option too.</description>

      <description>We had a reasonably quiet OCC last Friday in the Rubicon Boardroom but the attendees had plenty to say to Roland Steinmetz of Shared Visions and Simon Martin of Home Help Tech. Both gave great presentations on their businesses and we all tried to give useful feedback and questions.
With no negativity directed at Roland and Simon, I failed in my role as timekeeper and we ran way over on the demo session.</description>

A big thank you again to Kay Wright for facilitating this, sponsoring the refreshments and making us so welcome. And tip o the hat to Pat Phelan for co-ordinating it with Webworks and providing the projector.
We have a bunch of Qik videos of the morning. These include the round table quick introductions and the bulk of Phoebe Bright&amp;rsquo;s session on future energy scenarios.</description>

They meet the first Friday of every month at 8.30am in ArcLabs in Carrignore. It is very well sign-posted coming from Cork and is in a fabulous location.

      <description>When Cork OCC kicked off, we used Upcoming.org as the site on which to list the dates of the meetups. For a variety of technical reasons I moved that to Eventful after a few months. Unfortunately, most of the blogs/sites that list technology/business events in Ireland use Upcoming so we are missing out on some publicity opportunities. The switch-back shouldn&amp;rsquo;t make a huge difference to most attendees. I&amp;rsquo;ll change the widget in the sidebar to point to Upcoming and you can subscribe to the RSS feed if you like.</description>

The Dublin one is tomorrow (Thursday 31st Jan) in the Morrison Hotel at 9am. I have to say I love that venue. Bright and airy, with really friendly staff, good coffee and free Wifi. There is parking just around the corner (or try Arnotts or Jervis Street).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m trying to plan slightly further ahead than previously and nail down the next few OCCs. This Friday is obviously in the NSC. After that I think we should shoot for:
 * 8th Feb - City Centre. Either Webworks or Luigi Malones. If someone wants to demo that day then we should try and get Webworks. Please let me know if you want to take that slot * 22nd Feb - Back to Rubicon.</description>

It also looks like there is plenty of interest in discussing outsourcing etc. We have several OCC members (including my own company) that outsource design, development and other tasks.</description>

      <description>I think the 2008 kick-off went particularly well on Friday with the addition of a small bit pf structure helping things immensely. For those of you who couldn&amp;rsquo;t make it, here is a quick recap and links to some videos.
 * We held it in the boardroom of the Rubicon Centre to get access to a projector * John and Gordon from eWrite Essentials sponsored the Mr Cotton Coffee * After some general stand-around chats, we had a very interesting round table about * Cork OpenCoffee itself * how it can be more effective * ideas for making sure people didn&#39;t just huddle with friends, * Rotating locations * Rotating days of the week * Publishing the full set of dates and locations for the year * Gordon&#39;s document sharing initiative * General helping/sharing ideas * the structure of the meetups -best balance between free form networking and highly organised * After an introduction from John on what they hoped to gain from presenting eWrite Forms, Gordon then presented the product and the ideas around the business * There was immediate interest from the group and a long Q&amp;amp;A session ensued with tons of ideas put forward, directions discussed and a general brainstorm * David Reilly then gave some great thoughts on the sharing of documents and other issues around start-ups generally.</description>

      <description>As a commercial lawyer in PJ O&#39; Driscolls Solicitors in Bandon I think its a great idea to share a fairly standard legal document such as an NDA.
However, as a heads up, in these matters it is the background legal (and commercial) advice that is as important as the document itself, so, in the same spirit, please see some material legal and commercial pointers which I hope might be useful:</description>

      <description>We had a little lull there towards the end of 2007 but the interest expressed by many people in OCC over the Christmas means that 2008 should be full of energy.
Our first event of the year is in the Rubicon in CIT on Friday 11th from 10am-12midday. This time however, it isÂ in the Boardroom upstairs (ask reception for details).
We want to have a specific focus in each upcoming session combined ideally with someÂ sort of presentation or demo by one of the 61 people on this mailing list (or by other invited guests).</description>

      <description>At some point every start-up will need documents to be written such as a Requirements document or a Business plan to explain their ideas to developers and investors.
Google may be a first port of call. It will provide you with many useful avenues to explore. As Open Coffee members I feel we have a great opportunity to collaborate to make solid and well rounded guidelines for anyone to use to promote their own ideas.</description>

      <description>The turnout for yesterday&amp;rsquo;s OCC was smaller than usual as expected due to the Bank Holiday Weekend. However we did have some superb conversations mainly focused on mobile, mobile services, SMS, Jaiku, Swarmteams and Location Based Services. A very interested side-chat occurred on To-Do list applications and how weak many of them are. Our current tool in LouderVoice (Remember The Milk) is good particularly due to Google integration but still frustrates.</description>

      <description>Our regular meet-up in the Rubicon is on again at 10am this Friday. Despite the Bank Holiday, we thought we would go ahead as usual. A few items which you may wish to discuss:
 * The [MashupCamp event](http://www.web2ireland.org/2007/10/22/mashupcamp-great-speaker-line-up/) is coming to Dublin on Nov 10-12th. If you are involved in web development, this could be very interesting for you. * I have been given several free tickets (worth over â‚¬1000 each) to the [Web2Expo Event](http://berlin.</description>

      <description>We have had an offer from one of the Rubicon companies that I would like to run past you. They wish to conduct a user forum as part of Cork OpenCoffee this coming Friday 28th. This will allow them to get some feedback on their product offering.
They will sponsor scones/buns and coffee for the morning. They will have someone from outside their company to act as a facilitator to focus the group and take the responses.</description>

      <description>From Denise in GEP:
 I spoke with Cillian in Revenue last week before he went on holidays re coming down to Cork to do open session on BES/SCS- he said although there were headline announcements in the news in the last 2 weeks, the details have still not been worked out and will have to go through the Dail (which is just resumed) before Revenue will start any public discussion on it.</description>

      <description>After such a great turnout at the last one, I hope we have even more new faces this week. Unfortunately I probably won&amp;rsquo;t be able to make it as I&amp;rsquo;ll be coming back from the DemoBar event in Dublin. If I catch an early enough train I may make part of the session. I have received no update on BES/SCS. If anyone else has, please share it with the group. On Will Knott&amp;rsquo;s suggestion, I contacted Cillian Byrnes in the Revenue Commissioners regarding the possibility of him doing interviews which would capture all the important details of both schemes.</description>

      <description>A while back Diarmuid Wrenne of Lukulu made the great suggestion that we hold Cork OCC in the Rubicon out in CIT. We had the first of two trial meet-ups on Friday and I think it was a roaring success. It looked to me that more than twenty people came and went in the two hours. We had regulars, Rubicon incubator companies and new attendees too which was particularly gratifying.</description>

      <description>The OpenCoffee Club was started in London to encourage entrepreneurs, developers and investors to organise real-world informal meetups to chat, network and grow.
Cork OCC is one of 66 globally which have been founded since February. Imagine it as a big open lounge where people come and go, talk to others in their industry, showcase demos of what they are working on, save the world, and ultimately maybe get some work done and run a few small meetings.</description>
