Damian Beresford posted a comment here earlier pointing to information about Waterford OpenCoffee. Given that they are just up the road and on this side of Waterford, I hope we can pay them a much overdue visit.

They meet the first Friday of every month at 8.30am in ArcLabs in Carrignore. It is very well sign-posted coming from Cork and is in a fabulous location.

Their main page is [on Ning here](http://occwaterford.ning.com/)

and Damian has further information [on his blog here](http://www.damianberesford.com/2008/02/07/waterford-open-coffee-club/).
