This morning [David Reilly from Reilly & Co Solicitors](http://dreilly.ie) spoke to Corks Open Coffee about Commercial Law.

It was an excellent presentation, David covered a lot of very relevant topics focused on those in commercial software development in a short time. 

Davids presentation was called **The Creation, Protection and Exploitation of Software - A Practical and Non-Harming Legal Review** and covered the following areas:
 
- Legal background to ownership of software - VCs and The Exit Strategy
- Protection and Infringement of software
- Exploitation of software - how to get it right from the very start
 
A practical and commercial legal review aimed at software developers and those dealing in IT contracts.
