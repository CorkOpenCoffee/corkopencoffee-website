The next meet-up is back in the boardroom of the Rubicon Centre in CIT. Thanks to Paul and the team for facilitating this.

The demo will be by Shared Visions and will consist of an overview/discussion of current state/predictions of remote communication solutions. This includes Web Conferencing, Online Meetings, Call Conferencing, Webcasting, Webinars, IP Video Conferencing and Remote Support. Thanks to Denise Kennedy for suggesting this.

Based on your feedback we will keep this session limited to 30 mins.

If you would like to do a very short (~2 min) elevator pitch to see what people think, let me know ahead of time via email or as a comment and we'll include that too.
