      <description>Hi Occers,
The next Cork Open Coffee is this Friday the 16th at 10am in The Rubicon Center.
Its a bit soon to have an open coffee again after last weeks Your Country Your Call talk but weâ€™re doing it to keep on track with the calendar bookings for the board room in the Rubicon for the year.
The closing date for YCYC is the end of the month, so get your ideas in now.</description>
