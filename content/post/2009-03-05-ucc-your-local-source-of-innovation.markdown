Cork OCC on **Friday March 6th will be held in the Rubicon Centre, Bishopstown** and we are delighted to welcome James Little, the External Liaison Officer at the Cork Constraint Computation Centre, part of Computer Science Dept at UCC to present to us on how new businesses & entrepreneurs in the area could benefit from working with their local university.

**
Companies depend on innovation, yet how do you find this if you are thinking of starting or expanding a company? UCC may have the answer.**

The government has been funding many research projects with the
university over the past five years. Most of these have been
established with the objective of a commercial outcome, yet the
Intellectual Property (IP), software and ideas can only be taken so far
within a university environment. It is the role of the University's
Technology Transfer Office to bring these inventions out into the
commercial market place. This presents a real challenge, linking
entrepreneurs with ready available fully developed IP, which could
provide the seed for a start-up company, the refocus of an existing
company or an additional product to an established one.

_James will outline the current mechanism within UCC for accessing and negotiating IP while disclosing one or two examples._

**When?Â  Friday 6th March 10am - 12pm**

**Where? Rubicon Centre, Bishopstown, Cork**
