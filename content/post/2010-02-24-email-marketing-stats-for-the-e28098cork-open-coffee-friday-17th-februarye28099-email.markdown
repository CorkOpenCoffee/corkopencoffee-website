The last Cork Open Coffee reminder email to members was sent on Wednesday the 17th of February at 3.50pm.

This was an afternoon email compared to a mid morning email the last time.

As promised, here are its stats:



	  * Email sent to 160 email recipients. (+3 from last email)
	  * Subject length: 6 Words (37 characters, +1 character from  last email)
	  * Open Rate: 32.5% (up 2.9% from  last email)
	  * Bounce Rate: 1.3% (Down from last email)
	  * Click Rate: 13.9% (Up from last email)
	  * Unsubscribe: 0
	  * New Subscriptions: 0

The Open rate and Click rate have both improved from the last email with a drop in Bounce rate making it a more successful campaign overall.  Perhaps an afternoon email after 3pm to people is better than a mid morning after 10am email?

This time, the most popular links to be clicked were the link to the map (10.3%), the link showing the previous email stats (51.7%) and the link asking people to follow [@corkopencoffee](http://www.twitter.com/corkopencoffee) on Twitter (13.8%).

There is an email going out to Cork Open Coffee members this afternoon about Cork Open Coffee 'After Dark', an evening meeting of Open Coffee members that can't make it for the morning meetings. The stats of that will be put up on this blog too.
