      <description>The next Cork OpenCoffee is on Friday June 6th in Luigi Malone&amp;rsquo;s on Emmet Place at 10am. The one after that is back to the Rubicon Centre in CIT.
We won&amp;rsquo;t have a formal demo slot in Luigi&amp;rsquo;s but as always everyone should feel free to whip out their laptops to show us what they are working on.
The Demo Slot on the 20th will have Paul Harrington show us MapEnable.</description>
