We had a little lull there towards the end of 2007 but the interest expressed  by many people in OCC over the Christmas means that 2008 should be full of  energy.

Our first event of the year is in the Rubicon in CIT on Friday 11th from  10am-12midday. This time however, it isÂ in the Boardroom upstairs (ask reception  for details).

We want to have a specific focus in each upcoming session combined ideally  with someÂ sort of presentation or demo by one of the 61 people on this mailing  list (or by other invited guests).

To that end, I'd like this first event to be around the idea of knowledge and  document sharing by start-ups. Rather than re-inventing the wheel every time on  standard docs and templates like NDAs, Contracts etc, it would be fantastic if  people would offer some of these to the wider community. See ([/2008/01/03/an-open-coffee-collaboration/](/2008/01/03/an-open-coffee-collaboration/))  for more details. I'd love to hear suggestions on Friday for things that might  be shared (Elevator Pitch PPT templates, old Feasability Study Applications etc  etc.)

In addition, Gordon Murray from eWrite will give a presentation on the latest  project he is working on. "eWrite Essentials develop their own CMS and Apps for  SMEs. They have put a lot of research into methods to protect web forms against  spam and have decided to spin out this work as a service called eWrite Forms  during 2008."

Gordon is seeking feedback and suggestions from the group on this project so  please be open with your thoughts.

If you would like to present your idea, product, service, company, advice,  state body or expertise to the group please email me or talk to me on Friday. We  want no shrinking violets, don't be in anyway coy about pitching what you  have.

As always, thoughts/ideas/suggestions welcome.
