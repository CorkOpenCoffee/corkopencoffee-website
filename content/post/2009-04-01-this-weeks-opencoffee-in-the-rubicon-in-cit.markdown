This week's Cork OpenCoffee is in the Rubicon building in CIT from 10am-12pm.

The demo/talk slot is about a new business idea from John Peavoy, Bartosz Ptaszynski and Phoebe Bright. It is about helping companies jumpstart their software ideas. They would like to share their plans so far and hear your views on whether the business will work, and if so, what markets they could target and who they should involve.

We will ask [Mr Cotton](http://www.mrcotton.com/) to provide the coffee and this will require a small donation from everyone to cover the cost.

Thanks again to the Rubicon for kindly hosting us.

Conor O'Neill
