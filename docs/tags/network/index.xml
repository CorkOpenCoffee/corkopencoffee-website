      <description>Just a few notes on the latest from Cork OpenCoffee.
 * We&#39;re in today&#39;s Examiner! Half page piece including a picture I took at the Tapasol Demo in the Rubicon Boardroom. * Aileen Cussen wants to thank everyone who donated last Friday. She raised almost â‚¬700 from a total of â‚¬4000. In addition, she got multiple offers of help and expertise for the trip to Uganda including Wifi/internet guidance, laptop configuration, CD burning and local contacts.</description>
