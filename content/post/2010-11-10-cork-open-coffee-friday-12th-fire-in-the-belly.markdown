This week Yanky Fachler, author of 'Fire in the Belly' will be giving a talk at Cork Open Coffee at 10am in the Rubicon Centre.

Yanky will have copies of his book with him for anyone to buy.

**Fire in the Belly, An exploration of the entrepreneurial mindset**

_EXCERPTS FROM THE BOOK:_

_ _



	  * Fire in the belly is the fuel that drives you. With fire in your belly, you’re invincible
	  * With so many people now considering self-employment, it’s critical to make the emotional transition from employee to self-employed.
	  * Every entrepreneur has chutzpah - it’s in our DNA. Encourage your chutzpah genie to escape.
	  * The goal of the education system is to produce employable people who will fill society’s jobs.
	  * Families are incapable of giving “Recovering Employees” emotional support.
	  * Feeling lonely can be the number one challenge.
	  * To be your own boss, you must undergo deprogramming to ditch your employee mindset.
	  * People say that unless you are prepared to work hard, you should not start a company. Wrong. Unless you already work hard, don’t even think of starting your own business.
	  * Some employees should never be tempted to leave the employment world. Others should never have been employed in the first place. Asking whether entrepreneurship is for you is the wrong question. The real question is whether you are right for entrepreneurship.
	  * You’re never too old or too young to start a business.
