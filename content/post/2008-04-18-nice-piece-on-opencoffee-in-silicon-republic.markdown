Marie Boran from [Silicon Republic](http://www.siliconrepublic.com/) has always taken a strong interest in Irish start-up activity. I remember she was the first to get in contact when Paddy's Valley was announced.

She has written [a very nice piece](http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/news.nv?storyid=single10784) in today's Silicon Republic (not sure if it'll be syndicated to Irish Independent or not) about OpenCoffee in Ireland.

You can follow [Marie on Twitter here](http://twitter.com/pixievondust). They've also enabled a feed of their stories [to Twitter here](http://twitter.com/siliconrepublic).
