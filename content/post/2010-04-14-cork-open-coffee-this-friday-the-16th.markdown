Hi Occers,

The next **Cork Open Coffee is this  Friday the 16th at 10am in [The Rubicon Center](http://www.rubiconcentre.ie/)**.

Its a bit soon to have an open  coffee again after last weeks [Your Country Your Call](http://yourcountryyourcall.com/) talk but weâ€™re doing it to keep on track with the calendar bookings for the  board room in the Rubicon for the year.

The closing date for YCYC is the  end of the month, so [get your ideas in now](http://proposals.yourcountryyourcall.com/).

Thank you all for commenting  about attendance on the blog post and for attending the Your Country Your Call  talk given last week in [The National Software centre](http://www.nsc-campus.com/).

Thank you to all at the staff at NSC for hosting  the event.

Some photos from the day can be seen on the [YCYC Flickr page](http://www.flickr.com/photos/yourcountryyourcall/sets/72157623699043085/) and we are told we will be on **[Nationwide](http://www.rte.ie/news/nationwide/) this evening, the 14th at 7pm on RTE1** so tune in if you can.

This week, a Cork business called [Tender3D](http://www.tender3d.com/) will  be giving a demo of their application called Tender3D and hoping for your  feedback.

Tender3D is a  dedicated online marketspace that enables purchasers to connect with the most  appropriate suppliers of 3D animation content. The Tender3D software enables  purchasers to place their 3D modelling and animation projects online to tender,  and for suppliers to bid on them.

Thank you all and talk to you on  Friday morning.

Conor, Ciara & Gordon
