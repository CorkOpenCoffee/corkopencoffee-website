Our second last OpenCoffee was in Luigi Malone's where [Pat Phelan](http://patphelan.net/twitterfone-launches-speak-your-tweets/), from Cubic Telecom, demoed [TwitterFone](http://www.twitterfone.com/) to us all. We were all sworn to secrecy until the official launch which happened last night. The [response](http://twitter.com/patphelan/statuses/805054098), as we all predicted, has been [overwhelming](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/06/use-twitterfone-for-easy-voice-to-text-on-twitter/).

Apart from the fact that it's a fabulous service, there are some strong lessons to be learned from the TwitterFone development.



	  * Do it, do it, do it do it. Don't talk about it, just do it! Pat has had such amazing successes because he executes brilliantly
	  * Partner with like-minded companies. If your offering is going to be stronger combined with someone else's, then don't be afraid of working closely with them.
	  * Use your networks to find people who can help you build your vision and get it launched more quickly
	  * If you are a service provider, focus on mutual value not price. Even at the simplest level, think of the free publicity you'll get with the launch of something you helped build.
	  * Demo and solicit feedback as early as possible. Keep the vision but stay open to suggestions of your peers.

I know of two OCC regulars who have kicked into high-gear on their app development as a result of Pat's Demo and advice in Luigi's. I hope we see even more.

Well done Pat!
