      <title>Citylocal Cork Sponsoring Cork OpenCoffee</title>

      <description>Since Cork OpenCoffee began in early 2007, we&amp;rsquo;ve had some intermittent sponsorship of the coffee and scones which has always been appreciated. So we&amp;rsquo;re delighted that Paul Brugger from Citylocal Cork has agreed to sponsor three of the Rubicon sessions (with the first one just two days ago).

This means no more icky instant coffee and the arrival of the great Mr Cotton coffee instead. By the way, well done to Declan for his appearance on TV3 this week.</description>

      <description>This week&amp;rsquo;s Cork OpenCoffee is in the Rubicon building in CIT from 10am-12pm.
The demo/talk slot is about a new business idea from John Peavoy, Bartosz Ptaszynski and Phoebe Bright. It is about helping companies jumpstart their software ideas. They would like to share their plans so far and hear your views on whether the business will work, and if so, what markets they could target and who they should involve.</description>
