The next Open Coffee is on this Friday the 6th in the Rubicon at 10am. Michael Minehane from [Minehane Chartered Accountants](http://www.minehane-group.com/) will talk about corporation tax and R&D rules for Irish businesses followed by Q & A.

**Book Swap**

If anyone would like to swap some business books or recommended reading, please bring them along. I will bring along “The mythical man month” and “Once you're lucky, Twice you're good” if anyone would like to borrow them for a while.

**Mr Cotton Coffee**

Coffee will be supplied by [Mr Cotton](http://www.mrcotton.com/) this week at Open Coffee. There will be flasks of the good stuff for us to dig in to during the morning. There was plenty of change left over from the last Open Coffee in Luigi's which pays for it. The Mr. Cotton van will also be outside from around 11.15 onwards for espressos, cappuccinos etc.

As always, Open Coffee is open to all so feel free to bring people along. If you are interested in presenting your product or service at Open Coffee, we'd love to hear from you at [corkopencoffee@gmail.com](mailto:corkopencoffee@gmail.com)
