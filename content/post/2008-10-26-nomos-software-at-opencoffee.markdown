Tricia and David from [Nomos Software](http://www.nomos-software.com/) demoed their software on Friday. Whilst it was a highly technical topic, we had an excellent QA session about the business side of things. From their own site: "Nomos Software applies model driven engineering, code generation and declarative rules-based techniques to the management and control of data".

This was the first OCC session where we aimed for tight time control and it worked very well. 15+ people introduced themselves quickly and the demo was 30 minutes long including Q&A.

It was great to have Tom Doherty from [Waterford OCC](http://occwaterford.ning.com/) visit us too. We will have to do a few outward bound visits in the coming months to Waterford and Limerick.
