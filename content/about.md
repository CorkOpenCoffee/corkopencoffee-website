The OpenCoffee Club was started in London to encourage entrepreneurs, developers and investors to organise real-world informal meetups to chat, network and grow.

Cork OCC is one of 66 globally which have been founded since February. Imagine it as a big open lounge where people come and go, talk to others in their industry, showcase demos of what they are working on, save the world, and ultimately maybe get some work done and run a few small meetings.

The Cork Club launched on March 16th 2007 in Luigi Malone's in Cork City. Â This blog was launched on August 31st 2007.

OCC is not just another social networking event - if you don't make it along, it's not the end of the world - there's one every second week. You don't have to go round speaking to everyone - sometimes it's good to meet a few good people and a few in-depth discussions.

We'd love to see lots of demos, you never know, it might stir some ideas for business partnerships with people or they may be able to match you with people who can help and enhance your offering.

We don't do nametags, it's not really an event - it's a place where people come and go for coffee, chat, and a scone.

There is no filtering - open means open, anyone can attend and it's up to the people who come to make the most of it. We're aiming for an overwhelmingly positive can-do atmosphere.

Journalists, VCs, and Angels are more than welcome.

We'd love to see you there.
