      <description>Tricia and David from Nomos Software demoed their software on Friday. Whilst it was a highly technical topic, we had an excellent QA session about the business side of things. From their own site: &amp;ldquo;Nomos Software applies model driven engineering, code generation and declarative rules-based techniques to the management and control of data&amp;rdquo;.

This was the first OCC session where we aimed for tight time control and it worked very well.</description>
