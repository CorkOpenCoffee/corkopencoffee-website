I sent this email to Cork Open Coffee members last Wednesday at 7.50pm. This was an evening campaign so I was curious to see any differences in open rates and click rates compared to the last couple of campaigns sent earlier in the day.



	  * Email sent to 167 email recipients. (+7 from last email)
	  * Subject length: 5 Words (29 characters, -8 characters from last email)
	  * Open Rate: 26.9% (down 5.6% from the last email)
	  * Bounce Rate: 1.2% (Down 0.1% from last email)
	  * Click Rate: 3.6% (down 10.3% from last email)
	  * Unsubscribe: 0
	  * New Subscriptions: 0

The open rate is down a little this time. This is to be expected I imagine because at 8pm in the evening most people are at home and away from their computer.

The click rate is down quite a bit too, over 10%.  This email had only 4 calls to action, 2 in the content and 2 footer links. The last email had 8 links with a resulting click rate of 13.9%. This email just didn’t have a lot for people to do.

Interestingly, it was one of the links towards the end of the email, the link to the Cork Open Coffee blog that got all the clicks, instead of the map link like I’d expect since that was up top.

The opens and clicks all peaked 1 hour after the email was sent and dropping off after that, someone opened the email at 3am! There were a couple of opens and clicks again the following morning after 9am with some small activity right through the working hours of Thursday.

Looking back over the past couple of campaigns, nearly all the open and click activity happens within the first hour after the campaign is sent.
