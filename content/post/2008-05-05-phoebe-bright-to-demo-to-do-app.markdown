The next demo slot on May 9th will have Phoebe Bright presenting her To-Do application. I've seen an earlier incarnation of this in action and I think it is very competitive to what's out there and has some unique features. In Phoebe's own words:


<blockquote>**Another To Do List Application**

This has been my pet project for two years, but stimulated by a conversation at Open Coffee a few weeks ago, I am heading off in a new direction with it and I'd love to get some feedback.  The requirements for this to do list are:

> 
> 
	  * Differentiate between important and urgent


	  * Allow addition of comments and emails


	  * Store online but accessible by email


	  * Use of free format keywords


	  * Only show me a limited number of items at a time (otherwise I get depressed)


	  * Offer me an incentive for getting things done.

It was this last one that got me thinking and the new interface involves  piles, desks (clean and normal), boxes, housekeepers and rummaging in the archives!</blockquote>
