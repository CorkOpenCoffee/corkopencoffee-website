Can IT support independent living for those living alone?

A study is being undertaken by Dundalk IT in conjunction with ADA Security todetermine if it is possible to prolong self-sufficient living of the older citizens in Ireland.

Gerry o Mahony of ADA Security systems will be giving a presentation on an Assistive Technology Study this Friday at the Fermoy Youth Centre at 11:00am to examine if such technologies can help a person in their day to day living.

 

50 people are being asked to volunteer for the study and will be provided withinformation, training and the following equipment: tablet computers, room sensors, door sensors, blood pressure cuffs, weighing scales and a Pulse Oximetry device to record blood oxygen saturation.

 

For further details on the Study or to register your interest please contact Mary Allen on 025 33411.
