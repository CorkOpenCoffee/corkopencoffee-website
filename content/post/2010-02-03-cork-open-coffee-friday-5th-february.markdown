Hello all,

This weeks Cork Open Coffee will take place on Friday the 5th in [The Rubicon Centre](http://rubiconcentre.ie/) at 10am. If you need directions to the Rubicon, there is a [map on their website](http://rubiconcentre.ie/index.php/about-us/contact-us).

There are no speakers lined up yet, if you have a new or interesting web product you'd like to show and get feedback from a techie audience either this week on in the future, please let us know in the [blog comments](/) or by responding to this email.

If you think you'll be attending, please let us know in the [blog comments](/) so we can have an idea of numbers.

We have begun to use [Mailchimp](http://www.mailchimp.com) to send these email notifications to Cork Open Coffee members. The email list currently just shy of 160 members, is growing on a regular basis thanks to existing members recommending the meetings to other people. Please keep it up!

In keeping with the 'Open' of Cork Open Coffee, we will be publishing some email marketing data such as open rates and clicks rates on the [Cork Open Coffee blog](http://www.corkopencoffee.org). No ones email address will be displayed on the blog, just some overview information and hopefully some useful data that might be of interest to members sending their own email marketing campaigns.

If there are any companies out there that would like to sponsor coffee for some of the meetings, please get in touch. In return youâ€™ll get some publicity about your business on the blog, email and Twitter.

Don't forget to follow [@Corkopencoffee](http://twitter.com/corkopencoffee) on Twitter!

Talk to you all on Friday,

Gordon.
