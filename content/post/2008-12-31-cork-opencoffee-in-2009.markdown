We've just had a fantastic 2008 in OCC and I think we can make it even better in 2009. A few quick thoughts as we race towards the end of the year.




  * OCC only works because of the attendees. Thanks to everyone who even attended one session this year.
  * Ciara and Gordon are doing a fantastic job re-invigorating OCC. I should have asked for their help earlier!
  * I'll post at least three months of dates for 2009 shortly. The Rubicon ones will obviously be fixed location. The other ones will continue to rotate between locations like Luigi's and NSC etc.
  * We'll run one brainstorming OCC soon where everyone's ideas for improving OCC can be discussed
  * Phoebe Bright has come up with the great idea of collecting a list of common challenges (e.g. SEO) and running group self-help sessions on them.
  * We'll have more one-off special OCCs like the Tom Keane one during the year. Details TBA. Thanks again to John Fitzgerald for arranging the Tom one.
  * Thanks to everyone who sponsored coffee and hosted events during the year.
  * An extra special thanks to the Rubicon Centre for being our base. That's Paul, Margaret, Maeve and Felix.
  * Don't forget the Demo Slots. They can be used to propose product/business ideas too, you don't have to have anything to show.
  * Have a great New Year.
