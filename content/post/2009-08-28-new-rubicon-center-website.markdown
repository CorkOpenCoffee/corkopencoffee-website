The [Rubicon Center](http://www.rubiconcentre.ie/) which hosts many of our Cork Open Coffee meetings has a grand spanking new website at [http://www.rubiconcentre.ie/](http://www.rubiconcentre.ie/). Its a great looking site with some great imagery from around the Rubicon building. Cork Open Coffee is in their Useful Links section.

The site contains plenty of information about the range of services offered in the Rubicon. If you're a start up business take a look at the [Enterprise Start programme](http://www.rubiconcentre.ie/index.php/programmes/enterprise-start-prog) and the [Genesis Enterprise programme](http://www.rubiconcentre.ie/index.php/programmes/genesis-programme).

Keep an eye on the [Latest News](http://www.rubiconcentre.ie/index.php/latest-news) section of the site for enrolments for these programmes and other goings on in the Rubicon. The Enterprise Start programme is taking enrolments right now.

The Admin section allows us to book the conference room for Friday mornings for Open Coffee demos, we’re booked in for the next few months so we’re well prepared for the next few meetings.
