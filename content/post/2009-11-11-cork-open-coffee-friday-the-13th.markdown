**Hi OCCers,**

This weeks Cork Open Coffee is in the Rubicon Centre, CIT Campus Bishopstown on Friday 13th from 10am - 12pm.  It will be held downstairs in the lobby area as the Seminar Room is booked.

The demo slot will be taken up by one of our newest regulars, Israel Finnerty.  Israel & his partner Dawn Manning will be showcasing their new company FireSale.ie - Ireland's first Buy, Sell, Haggle & Auction website.  The site will be previewed along with a discussion of the FireSale.ie opening event on November 20th in Corks Vision Centre.

**Coffee and Delicious nibbles**

Thanks to generous sponsorship from [ CityLocal Cork](http://www.citylocal.ie/cities/cork/), there will be great coffee from [Mr Cotton Coffee](http://www.mrcotton.com/) and some delicious freshly baked healthy foods from [Delicious.ie](http://www.delicious.ie/) available.
