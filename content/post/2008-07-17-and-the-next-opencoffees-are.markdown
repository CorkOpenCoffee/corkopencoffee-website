The following are the next OCCs in Cork:



	  * Tomorrow Friday 18th - Luigi Malones on Emmet Place 10am. No formal demos but    as always feel free to whip out a laptop and show us all what you are working    on.
	  * Friday August 1st - No OpenCoffee. We tend to have minimal turnout on Bank    Holiday weekends
	  * Friday August 15th - Joint OpenCoffee-[SohoSolo](http://www.sohosoloireland.com/) meet-up in the National    Software Centre in Mahon. We are starting this one early at 9am (running until    11). CorkBIC will give a short talk on the services they offer businesses in    Cork. On a personal note, I found have found them and the associated Business    Angels Partnership very helpful.
