The turnout for yesterday's OCC was smaller than usual as expected due to the Bank Holiday Weekend. However we did have some superb conversations mainly focused on mobile, mobile services, SMS, Jaiku, Swarmteams and Location Based Services. A very interested side-chat occurred on To-Do list applications and how weak many of them are. Our current tool in LouderVoice (Remember The Milk) is good particularly due to Google integration but still frustrates.

I'm delighted to announce that the Rubicon Centre will be sponsoring the coffee at OCC from now on. A big thank you to Paul Healy for making this happen. A big thank-you also to Mr Cotton who has been providing the high quality product at each session.

However, we do have to take care of scones/nibbles ourselves so I would ask you to email me at corkopencoffee AT gmail DOT com if you are willing to be part of a round-robin system for paying and getting these for each session.

As always, thoughts and suggestions to the email address or as comments here.
