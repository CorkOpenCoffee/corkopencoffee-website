This week's Cork OpenCoffee is back to our old haunt of Luigi Malones from  10-12 on Friday.

As always with Luigi's, we have no formal demos. However we may  have [Diarmuid Wrenne](http://www.bluekulu.com/) and [Gordon Murray](http://www.ewritecork.com/) doing a head2head between their Medion  and Asus teeny-tiny laptops. Hopefully we'll broadcast that live on [Qik.com](http://qik.com/conoro).  I'll also be showing an early version of LouderVoice for Business if anyone  wants a look.

If you have anything you want to show off and would like a mention  here on the blog, just drop me a line.
