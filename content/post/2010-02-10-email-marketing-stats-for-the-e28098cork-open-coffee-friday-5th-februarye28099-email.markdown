The last Cork Open Coffee reminder email to members was sent on Wednesday the 3rd of February at 9.50am. As promised, here are its stats:



	  * Email sent to 157 email recipients.
	  * Subject length: 6 Words (36 characters).
	  * Open Rate: 29.6%
	  * Bounce Rate: 3.2%. (Hard bounces, emails no longer exist)
	  * Click Rate: 11.8%
	  * Unsubscribe: 0
	  * New Subscriptions: 5

There were 7 links in the email. The most popular link clicked was the link to the Cork Open Coffee Blog. I wrote in the email that I would be publishing this email marketing information followed by this link to the blog which received 28.6% of the clicks.

In the image below, the percentage of clicks to each link can be seen. It is interesting to see the links with the most clicks were sort of in the middle of the email, I would have assumed the links towards the beginning of the email would have received a bit more attention.

The last time a recipient clicked on any of the links was almost exactly 48 hours later, 5 minutes before the beginning of Open Coffee that Friday morning. 21 people attended the Open Coffee morning that morning, a ‘bum-on-seat’ rate of 13.4%.

Most people opened the email only once or twice. A couple of people opened the email as many as 15-20 times! I wonder why that that figure is so high.

Most of the email activity was in the first two hours after the email was sent with the most clicks happening in the first hour.

The Cork Open Coffee email was sent using MailChimp and the Stats were taken from MailChimps dashboard.
