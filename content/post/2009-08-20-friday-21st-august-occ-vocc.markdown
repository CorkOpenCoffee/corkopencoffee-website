Hi OCCers!




This weeks Cork Open Coffee Club is on in the Rubicon Centre in Bishopstown, near CIT Campus.  Please note that parking is limited at the moment due to building works so you may have to park in the CIT overflow car park.




Usual time: 10am - 12pm.




Roland Steinmetz from Shared Visions will be running Virtual Open Coffee (VOCC) again this week after the success of the last session.  




If you can't attend in person, be there virtually!  You will  have to accept a download and if you want to participate, plug in headset and camera before entering the meeting. This is PC only – no Mac or Linux at the moment unfortunately.  Here is the link for the #vocc for Friday: http://www.nefsis.com/join.html?dn=OCC




Roland will talk briefly at the beginning of the session to introd! uce the concept (he has promised us he won’t do sales!) just neutral benefits about savings in time, expenses and high end remote communication.  




Speakers:




We are always looking for speakers for our demo slots so if you (or anyone you know) has a new start up business idea and wants to get feedback from like-minded entrepreneurs, please do get in touch.  We request that no sales-pitches are done in these sessions, but they are used as a way to brainstorm about your idea/technology and make suggestions.  These usually last no more than 15/20 mins presentation and 10/15 mins Q&A.  




Looking forward to seeing you all there on Friday.  Don't forget, we are now on twitter so you can follow @CorkOpenCoffee for updates :)




Many thanks,




Ciara Crossan
