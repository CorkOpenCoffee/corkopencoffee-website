We're running a special one-off OpenCoffee this coming Monday (13th) instead of the usual Friday. It's a bit unusual in that we've invited a speaker to come in and talk about how he grew his business and raised funding. That person is Tom Keane, President of Nitrosell. He has a long history in the software biz and I know I'm not the only one who has a ton of questions to ask him.

This OpenCoffee is a joint one with SohoSolo and is on in the NSC at **9am**. Coffee and buns sponsored by CorkBIC and SohoSolo. Thanks to John Fitzgerald for arranging this with Tom.

Here's some background on Tom and Nitrosell:


<blockquote>Tom Keane is an engineering graduate of University College Cork and Trinity College Dublin and has over twenty five years experience at a senior level in the software business. Before co-founding NitroSell, Tom worked as a Software Engineer and ICT architect for leading software companies, including Motorola, Ericsson, Compaq, and Accenture. During 2007 and 2008 Tom was a member of the prestigious Microsoft S+S (Software plus Services) Partner Advisory Council, which met regularly in Seattle to discuss and advise on Microsoftâ€™s strategic new cloud computing products, campaigns, competitive positioning and go-to-market strategies. Fellow council members included CEOs and Presidents of companies including BT Tradespaces, Best Buy, Siemens, EMC/Conchango, Mamut, WebTrends, and Telus. Tom is an experienced presenter and regularly gets invited to speak on emerging technology and entrepreneurial matters.

NitroSell â€œmakes it easy for Retailers to increase their profits by extending their business with online multi-channel sales solutionsâ€.
