The next Cork OpenCoffee is on Friday 9th May in the NSC in Mahon. [Map here.](http://maps.live.com/?v=2&sp=Point.snf3cdg8zntx_NSC___&encType=1)

Many thanks to Catherine Wall in [it@cork](http://www.itcork.ie/) for arranging the boardroom in the NSC and to it@cork themselves for kindly  sponsoring the coffee.

We'll be back to the Rubicon again on 23rd May.

If you are interested in demoing your product/idea at either session or  giving a shortÂ talk on your area of expertise, please shout.

I'm also considering inviting someone in the VC/Corp Finance field to give us  a talk. Vote here on your level of interest:
