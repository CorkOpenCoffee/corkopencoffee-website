      <description>It has been over two years since the last one, but BarCamp is finally coming back to Cork. It&amp;rsquo;s soon, very soon, only four weeks away. The venue is the lovely Webworks building in the City Centre, just like the last time.
We have a strong vision for this event and we need your help to make it happen on the day. Please read the first set of posts and give us your feedback.</description>
