      <description>Just a quick reminder that OpenCoffee is tomorrow at 10am in Luigi Malone&amp;rsquo;s on Emmet Place.
We&amp;rsquo;ve just heard from Pat Phelan of Cubic Telecom that he&amp;rsquo;ll be doing a demo. Given how busy they have been this week, I&amp;rsquo;ve a feeling this is oneÂ not to miss!
Also, since thisÂ batch of the Genesis programme is coming to a close, it&amp;rsquo;d be great to hear from those who took part in it and hear what they gained from it.</description>
