Delighted to hear that the KK crew are finally having an [OpenCoffee at 11.30 this morning](http://www.kenmc.com/2009/01/06/kilkenny-open-coffee-its-a-possibility-its-this-week/) in the Kilkenny Cafe located downstairs in Market Cross Shopping Centre.

They join Cork, Limerick, Dublin, Waterford, Belfast and Galway as an [OCC](http://opencoffee.ning.com/) location. 

If you are based anywhere in the South-East, it’ll be worth checking out. Hopefully they’ll have attendees from Wexford, Waterford, Carlow, Tipperary, Offaly etc.
