When Cork OCC kicked off, we used [Upcoming.org](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/group/2849/) as the site on which to list the dates of the meetups. For a variety of technical reasons I moved that to Eventful after a few months. Unfortunately, most of the blogs/sites that list technology/business events in Ireland use Upcoming so we are missing out on some publicity opportunities. The switch-back shouldn't make a huge difference to most attendees. I'll change the widget in the sidebar to point to Upcoming and you can subscribe to the RSS feed if you like. You can also "join" the group on Upcoming if you have a Yahoo login.

I'll add the next meetup to Upcoming shortly. Just need to confirm that Webworks will be ok as the venue.
