Evert Bopp of the Greenhouse Incubator contacted me about [this great looking event](http://greenhouselimerick.com/news/events/“blogging-social-media-for-business”-seminar-absolute-hotel-limerick-june-13th/) in the Absolute Hotel in Limerick on June 13th.

They are running a full day Blogging & Social Media for Business seminar where you will be able to listen and talk to Irelands’ leading experts in social media & online networking.

	  * Fred Caballero: Web project manager at Channelship Web Agency, Video blogger.
	  * Peter Donegan: Landscape designer, celebrity blogger.

It costs €150 euro p/p incl. lunch, tea & coffee during the day. All proceeds of the day will go towards the GreenHouse incubator helping people to start their own business.
