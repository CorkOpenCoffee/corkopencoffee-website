The next OCC is today in the Rubicon Centre in CITÂ at our usual time of 10am-12. We'll have one informal demo from a new attendee.

I was also contacted by Brian O'Flaherty from UCC who will be there. The directors of the Masters in Business Information Systems (MBIS) programme at UCC are looking to work with Cork companies in the development of products and services for business.
