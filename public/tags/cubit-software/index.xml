      <description>This is my second time to write this post as the first one got deleted accidentally. We had a particularly good OCC meet-up last Friday in the Rubicon with four new faces. The round table introductions caused so many spin-off conversations that we ended up not doing anything else!
A welcome then to:
 * Bob Gee of [Connect Promotions](http://www.connectpro.ie/) who seemed delighted by the response of us all to his business (promotional items or schwag as we geeks call it).</description>
