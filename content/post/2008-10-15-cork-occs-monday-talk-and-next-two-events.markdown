Monday's special OCC in the NSC was exactly that, special. The boardroom was jammed full of people, many of them new faces to hear Tom Keane talk about [Nitrosell](http://www.nitrosell.com/), his history and his advice on growing a business. I was completely riveted by what he had to say since so much of it applied directly to what we are doing in LouderVoice. The questions at the end told me that he had affected many of the attendees in the same way. A big big thank you to Tom and I hope we can convince him to visit again so we can pick his brain even more!

That event was another successful co-host with SohoSolo/CorkBIC. Thanks to Jackie and Eileen for facilitating. Of course it wouldn't have happened without John Fitzgerald getting Tom in the first place. Watch out for some more talks in the coming months.

The next OCC is back to the Rubicon in CIT on October 24th at 10am. The one after that is in Luigi Malone's on November 7th.

We'll have a demo on the 24th from Tricia Balfe of [Nomos Software](http://www.nomos-software.com/). She describes it as follows:


<blockquote>Nomos Software has built a tool for validating XML data against a set of user-defined business rules. The tool allows you to perform the type of validation that is not possible using XML schemas. We allow users to express rules about the interdependencies between the data in XML files, and turn these rules into executable java code.</blockquote>
