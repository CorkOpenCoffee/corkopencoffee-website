There will be a special Open Coffee on this saturday 17th December @11am at the
National Software Centre, Mahon with Cork Coder Dojo.

The Coder Dojo is a weekly meetup where young people aged 6+ can learn the basics
of web development and build sites/apps with the help of the volunteers there.

Their web address http://www.codrcamp.com
Follow them on twitter @CoderDojo

This should be a great neworking event for all, and for people who usually
dont get to go to open coffee.
