      <description>The next OCC is today in the Rubicon Centre in CITÂ at our usual time of 10am-12. We&amp;rsquo;ll have one informal demo from a new attendee.
I was also contacted by Brian O&amp;rsquo;Flaherty from UCC who will be there. The directors of the Masters in Business Information Systems (MBIS) programme at UCC are looking to work with Cork companies in the development of products and services for business.

      <description>The next OCC would normally not be in the Rubicon but we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to have a special joint-one there this coming Friday, July 4th at 10am.
Aileen Cussen, who is an EI D.A. to many of you I&amp;rsquo;m sure (including ourselves) is going to Uganda to help build a school and educate some of the local children for a period of several weeks. It is being done as part of the Lake Lyantonde project which was initiated by the Kabata Farmers Group and run by the local community with an aim of creating awareness of, environmental conservation practices, safe water and sanitation, sustainable agriculture, HIV/Aids, and fostering general development for the community living near Lake Lyantonde.</description>

      <description>The next Cork OpenCoffee is on Friday June 6th in Luigi Malone&amp;rsquo;s on Emmet Place at 10am. The one after that is back to the Rubicon Centre in CIT.
We won&amp;rsquo;t have a formal demo slot in Luigi&amp;rsquo;s but as always everyone should feel free to whip out their laptops to show us what they are working on.
The Demo Slot on the 20th will have Paul Harrington show us MapEnable.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m chuffed to see that Haydn Shaughnessy mentions Cork OpenCoffee in his piece in the Innovation Magazine of today&amp;rsquo;s Irish Times. The point of the article is:
If companies want to be innovative in their field, not only do they need to rethink how they do business, but they also have to be willing to step out of their comfort zone He includes two quotes from me on OpenCoffee which I think are true for many of those who attend.</description>
