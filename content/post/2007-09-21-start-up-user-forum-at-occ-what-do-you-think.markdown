We have had an offer from one of the Rubicon companies that I would like to run past you. They wish to conduct a user forum as part of Cork OpenCoffee this coming Friday 28th. This will allow them to get some feedback on their product offering.

They will sponsor scones/buns and coffee for the morning. They will have someone from outside their company to act as a facilitator to focus the group and take the responses. Of course, if it's not of interest to you, please treat it as a standard OCC meeting since the user forum is opt-in only.

Let us know what you think by voting your preference below and add any comments you like to this post
