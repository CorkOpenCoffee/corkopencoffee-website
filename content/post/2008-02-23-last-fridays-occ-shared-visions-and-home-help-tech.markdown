We had a reasonably quiet OCC last Friday in the Rubicon Boardroom but the attendees had plenty to say to Roland Steinmetz of [Shared Visions](http://www.sharedvisions.ie) and Simon Martin of [Home Help Tech](http://www.homehelptech.com/). Both gave great presentations on their businesses and we all tried to give useful feedback and questions.

With no negativity directed at Roland and Simon, I failed in my role as timekeeper and we ran way over on the demo session. We'll try some sort of countdown timer at the next demo session to ensure that we keep the mix of demos and networking balanced.

I did a bunch of Qik videos of both presentations. Simon's final one is cut short as I ran out of battery on my phone. [Roland's are here](http://qik.com/streams/browse?sort=ratings&tag=shared%2Bvisions) and [Simon's here](http://qik.com/streams/browse?sort=ratings&tag=home%2Bhelp%2Btech).

Given that the topic of the day was the use of technology for remote communications and support, Roland also [recorded the presentations](http://www.present.ie/steinmetz/E959DC8283) using the products that [Shared Visions](http://sharedvisions.ie/) provides to businesses. The ability to jump to individual slides and get the appropriate video clip is a very useful feature!

The next OCC is in CIX in HollyHill on March 7th. I'll do a mailshot closer to the time.
