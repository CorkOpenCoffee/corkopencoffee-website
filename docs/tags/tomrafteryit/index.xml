      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve arranged a dinner for this coming Tuesday night in Cork City (final venue decision imminent). It is to wish fond farewell to OpenCoffee stalwart Tom Raftery who is moving to Spain with his family.
If you would like to attend, please let me know by e-mail to conor AT loudervoice DOT com by Saturday night at the latest. It should be a great night.</description>
