      <description>Elaine Rogers has just announced OpenCoffee Mallow. It&amp;rsquo;s fantastic to see another OCC in Munster and, having talked to Elaine, I know she has a great vision for facilitating business networking in that part of the county.
If you find the trip into Cork City or Limerick too far or you just need a change of scene, then why not attend?
The first one is on in Springfort Hall, New Twopothouse, Mallow, on Tues 7th July 2009 in the main bar from 10 am to 12 pm.</description>
