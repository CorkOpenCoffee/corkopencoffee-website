A few quick updates:






  1. Web2Ireland.org is having a big event in Dublin on Sep 13th in Ely HQ on Hannover Quay.

    * In the afternoon there will be "pitch" and presentation training
organised by Enterprise Ireland. This is for those presenting later that
day and also for people travelling on the Paddy's Valley Trip. Info

    * At 5pm there will be a social meet-up of Paddy's Valley people. Info

    * At 6.30pm there will be DemoBar and FOWA RoadTrip. DemoBar is about
startups demoing their web applications to a very influential crowd. I've some information on it here: [http://tinyurl.com/2x6xjj](http://tinyurl.com/2x6xjj)
    * Please feel free to badger me about the details on any of those things
on Friday.


  2. One of Amazon's Web Services Evangelists (Mike Culver) will be in Dublin on October 30th to talk about some of the amazing things they are doing. I'll send around full details and where to RSVP to in the next few days.
  3. Big congrats to OCC member Pat Phelan on Cubic Telecom raising â‚¬5m!
  4. The new BES limits have been approved by the EU. I think this is worth discussing on Friday.
  5. Anyone applying for SeedCorn? Love to have a chat about that too on Friday.
  6. If you are doing anything interesting in the web or mobile space and want to be covered on [blognation Ireland](http://ietech.blognation.com/), don't be shy about asking me!
  7. Conn O Muineachain will be down again to do some video interviewing. Note this is not live streaming, it is 1-1 interviews with those who elect to do them. So if you are camera shy, don't be concerned. If you want to get some exposure then I highly recommend that you do an interview, it could get you in front of a lot of people across Europe.
