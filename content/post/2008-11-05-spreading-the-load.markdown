I'd very happy to announce that the organisation of each Cork OpenCoffee session will be split between [me](http://business.loudervoice.com/), [Gordon Murray](http://www.ewritecork.com/) and [Ciara Crossan](http://www.weddingdates.ie/) from now on. I really appreciate them both agreeing to help out and each of us will organise every third event.

You'll see no major difference in OCC except that the person deciding the demos, doing the intros and sending the reminder emails will rotate.

To kick if off, Gordon will be arranging this Friday.
