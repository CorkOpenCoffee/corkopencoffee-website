The next Cork OCC is on this Friday in the board room of the NSC in Mahon. It  is a bit different from our normal get-together for two reasons. The first is  that it starts at 9am instead of the usual 10. The second is that it's a joint  event with [SohoSolo](http://sohosoloireland.com/). This means we'll  have a bigger group that usual. There won't be a formal demo but we will hear a  short intro about SohoSolo and the other services of [CorkBIC](http://www.corkbic.com/) who have been strong supporters of  OpenCoffee since it started. They are also kindly are sponsoring the  refreshments.
