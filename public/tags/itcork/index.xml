      <description>TheÂ it@cork annual conference has just been announced. Its title is &amp;ldquo;GREEN IT: Reduce CO2, Raise Profits&amp;rdquo; and it&amp;rsquo;s on November 26 in the lovely Radisson SAS Hotel in Cork.
The line-up looks like an excellent mix with the focus being clearly on Green as it relates to IT and Business. I particularly like the profit angle given the turmoil the world is going through right now
The is an Early Bird Discount available - Book on or before October 31 and it&amp;rsquo;s €250 for members, €350 for non members.</description>
