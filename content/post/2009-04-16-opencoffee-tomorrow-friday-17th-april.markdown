This weeks OCC is "_coffee in the city_" - we're going to go back to Nosh and Coffee, on Carey's Lane, near Paul Street Shopping Centre.

Friday 17th April 10am - 12pm.

No formal demos planned as we are in a coffee shop, but open networking and idea-sharing will abound as always :)

Hope to see you all there tomorrow and feel free to bring any friends or other interested parties, ALL WELCOME.

Kindest Regards,

Ciara
