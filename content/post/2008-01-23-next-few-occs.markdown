I'm trying to plan slightly further ahead than previously and nail down the next few OCCs. This Friday is obviously in the NSC. After that I think we should shoot for:



	  * 8th Feb - City Centre. Either Webworks or Luigi Malones. If someone wants to demo that day then we should try and get Webworks. Please let me know if you want to take that slot
	  * 22nd Feb - Back to Rubicon. Demo by Shared Visions on their webconf products
	  * 7th March - Open for takers. Either NSC again or a new venue, possibly in a company office?
