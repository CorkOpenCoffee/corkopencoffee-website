David Reilly from [PJ ODriscoll's](http://www.pjod.ie/) has put together a great overview of the key issues to be aware of in Confidentiality agreements. Gordon has made it available [via Google Docs here](http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dgt8d8k9_26hm8mkpc9). Any questions or comments can be added on this post and I'm sure David will address them.
