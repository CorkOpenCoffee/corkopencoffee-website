      <description>The guys from Tapasol have built some very interesting bare-metal provisioning and deployment software. I remember looking into this area in EMC a few years back and being disappointed by what was out there.
It&amp;rsquo;s great to see a local company doing something in this space, particularly one that came about due to the Motorola closure. The guys also recently won an award in this years Genesis Programme.
On Friday the 23rd they will talk about the challenges of deploying software on Unix servers and give a demonstration of their automated solution to build a Unix server from bare metal with a single command.</description>
