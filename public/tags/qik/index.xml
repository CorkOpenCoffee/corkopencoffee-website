      <description>This week&amp;rsquo;s Cork OpenCoffee is back to our old haunt of Luigi Malones from 10-12 on Friday.
As always with Luigi&amp;rsquo;s, we have no formal demos. However we may have Diarmuid Wrenne and Gordon Murray doing a head2head between their Medion and Asus teeny-tiny laptops. Hopefully we&amp;rsquo;ll broadcast that live on Qik.com. I&amp;rsquo;ll also be showing an early version of LouderVoice for Business if anyone wants a look.
If you have anything you want to show off and would like a mention here on the blog, just drop me a line.</description>

      <description>I took a series of videos of Paul Harrington&amp;rsquo;s presentation of Map Enable at the last OCC. Some really informative discussion ensued which would be of interest to any startup. Apologies for the sound quality, I really need to get a mini boom mic for my Nokia N95-8GB.</description>
