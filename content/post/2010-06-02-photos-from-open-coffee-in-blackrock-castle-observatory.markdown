Last Friday, Cork Open Coffee was invited to the [Blackrock Castle Observatory](http://bco.ie/) in Blackrock in Cork for coffee and a tour of the facility.

One of our new members, [Karl took some excellent photos](http://cit.karlgrabe.com/research/other/cocBlackrock/photos/pages/IMG_2200.htm) in and around the castle.

A huge thank you to the hard working people of the Observatory, especially Clair McSweeney who took some time out to give us a 3 hour tour in around 30 minutes.

The castle is an excellent place, full of information and I imagine everyone attending that morning would highly recommend taking a tour.
