**Hi Occers,**

This weeks Cork Open Coffee is taking place this Friday the 19th at 10am in [The Bodega,](http://www.bodegacork.ie/) Cornmarket street in Cork. No demos this week, just coffee and networking. The Bodega opens at 10am, they have free wifi and a [map on their website](http://www.bodegacork.ie/contact-bodega-pub.aspx) for how to get there.

In keeping with the 'Open' in Cork Open Coffee, we will be publishing the email campaign stats on the Cork Open Coffee Blog. You can [see the stats from the last email on the blog](../2010/02/10/email-marketing-stats-for-the-%E2%80%98cork-open-coffee-friday-5th-february%E2%80%99-email/) now. No ones email address will be displayed on the blog, just some overview information and hopefully some useful data that might be of interest to members sending their own email marketing campaigns.

Talk to you all on Friday,
