	  1. [Comhar](http://comhar.com/) will have a user/demo session for those who are interested (and are sponsoring refreshments)
	  2. it@cork encourages everyone to vote in the [Leaders Awards](http://www.itcork.ie/index.cfm/page/submitleaderawardnomination) which close tomorrow
	  3. I'll soon be moving over to proper mailing list software to make sub/un-sub easier and to prevent my constant mistakes with BCC!
	  4. In the meantime just email me at any stage to unsub from mails as almost everything will be published on this blog too.
