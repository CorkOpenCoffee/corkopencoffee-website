Last year's very successful [WebMission](http://www.webmission.co.uk) by UK startups to Silicon Valley followed in the footsteps of the equally successful [Paddy's Valley](http://www.paddysvalley.org/) several months previously. I've been contacted by James Lawn to let everyone know that Irish start-ups are very welcome on this year's trip.

They want to bring UK & Ireland’s top 20 fast-growing Enterprise Web Companies to San Francisco from 28 Mar to 3 Apr. Some good sponsorship means that you'd only have to pay for your flight and hotel. A word in the ear of your Enterprise Ireland D.A. may even cover half of that.

I have to say, the trip looks fantastic. This is what you can expect:



	  * Facilitated meetings with key US investors
	  * Meet and mingle with key Silicon Valley movers and shakers relevant to your organisation and growth plans
	  * Discuss your business with leading journalists
	  * Spend quality time with like-minded people in the valley
	  * Explore how to succeed and grow in the US market
	  * Attend Web 2.0 Expo which occurs during the same week
	  * Significant VP-level engagement with WebMission sponsors

 

The entry requirements are as follows:

	  * Be an Enterprise 2.0 company
	  * Be innovative
	  * Be headquartered in the UK or Ireland
	  * Have 2 years trading history, or failing that, compelling fast-track potential through management team etc
	  * Be able to provide references from key sponsors/industry players
	  * Able to demonstrate some commitment to sustainable business practices (eg, positive environmental, social or economic outputs)
	  * Be ready to do or grow business in the US OR potentially attractive to a US investor.
