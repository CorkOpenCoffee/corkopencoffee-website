      <description>Marie Boran from Silicon Republic has always taken a strong interest in Irish start-up activity. I remember she was the first to get in contact when Paddy&amp;rsquo;s Valley was announced.
She has written a very nice piece in today&amp;rsquo;s Silicon Republic (not sure if it&amp;rsquo;ll be syndicated to Irish Independent or not) about OpenCoffee in Ireland.
You can follow Marie on Twitter here. They&amp;rsquo;ve also enabled a feed of their stories to Twitter here.</description>
