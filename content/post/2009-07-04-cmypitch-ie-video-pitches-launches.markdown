Just a quick note for those of you in startups.  Adele Moran  from [cmypitch.ie](http://www.cmypitch.ie/) contacted us about their new site which has just launched. (Web2Ireland coverage here: [http://www.web2ireland.org/2009/06/29/cmypitch-launches-in-ireland/](http://www.web2ireland.org/2009/06/29/cmypitch-launches-in-ireland/)).

They connect entrepreneurs with investors through the means of video pitches. They seem to be serious operators with endorsements from the likes of Eddie Jordan (F1), Philip Lynch (IAWS, One51), Patrick Brazel (former Chairman of Irish Software Association), James Morris (Windmill Lane, TV3), Tony Kilduff (Kindle). They have also signed up several partners: Bank of Scotland (Ireland), Deloitte, The Irish Times, Microsoft and William Fry.




If you are looking for funding, it's looks like it's worth a punt.
