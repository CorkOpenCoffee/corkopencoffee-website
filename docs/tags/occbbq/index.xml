      <description>As many of you know, Evert Bopp is organising OpenCoffeeClub BBQ in Terryglass in Tipperary on Wednesday July 16th. It sounds like there are quite a few from Cork OpenCoffee interested in attending. If you are one of them (and I need definites), would you be interested in sharing the cost of a mini-bus to take us up and down? Please e-mail conor AT loudervoice DOT com if you are.</description>
