This Fridays Open Coffee talk at the Rubicon will be given by Jane Leonard, a Learning & Performance Specialist  [Website
 ](http://www.reallyusefultraininganddevelopment.ie/) she will focus on the importance of management skills in running a successful business. 
It will cover the classic management areas of Planning, organising, controlling and delegating. 
It wonâ€™t be preachy but it will remind people that how we manage ourselves is how we present ourselves to the world.  

There will also be a presentation from Martin Forrest who is starting his own business, running self defense training for the over 60's (the idea is that most over 60's have a walking stick, and thus a weapon to hand!).
He will give  a demonstration and has a short video presentation so it should be interesting!
