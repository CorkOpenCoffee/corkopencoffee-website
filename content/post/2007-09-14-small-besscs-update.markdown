From Denise in GEP:



<blockquote>
I spoke with Cillian in Revenue last week before he went on holidays re coming down to Cork to do open session on BES/SCS- he said although there were headline announcements in the news in the last 2 weeks, the details have still not been worked out and will have to go through the Dail (which is just resumed) before Revenue will start any public discussion on it.  We spoke of mid to late October as possible and I am keeping in touch with him on it and will keep you posted.

From other sources, there has been comments that it could go out to Dec 5th with the Budget.

Unfortunately, it sounds like the previous melee (was it 2004?) is going to happen all over again with everyone trying to get in before Dec 31st.
