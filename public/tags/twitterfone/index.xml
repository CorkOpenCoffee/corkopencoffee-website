      <description>Our second last OpenCoffee was in Luigi Malone&amp;rsquo;s where Pat Phelan, from Cubic Telecom, demoed TwitterFone to us all. We were all sworn to secrecy until the official launch which happened last night. The response, as we all predicted, has been overwhelming.
Apart from the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s a fabulous service, there are some strong lessons to be learned from the TwitterFone development.
 * Do it, do it, do it do it.</description>
