      <description>Just got this from Brian O&amp;rsquo;Flaherty in UCC:
On May 26th, the BIS Innovative Software Showcase presents the entrepreneurial endeavours of eleven companies from the MBS BIS Programme. Come and meet the entrepreneurs, their mentors and University staff at this prestigious showcase, which will be followed by an awards presentation.
A panel of external judges will evaluate the projects beforehand and award the BIS Innovation Prize which is kindly sponsored by Cork City Enterprise Board.</description>
