Another thoroughly enjoyable Cork OpenCoffee happened on Friday in [Webworks](http://www.webworkscork.com/) with 20+ in attendance. A big thank you again to Kay Wright for facilitating this, sponsoring the refreshments and making us so welcome. And tip o the hat to Pat Phelan for co-ordinating it with Webworks and providing the projector.

We have a bunch of [Qik videos](http://qik.com/streams/browse?sort=ratings&tag=corkopencoffee) of the morning. These  include the round table quick introductions and the bulk of Phoebe Bright's session on future energy scenarios. Phoebe's talk was very well received and focused on demand instead of supply. Since this is something we can all practically engage with, she had lots of questions and feedback.

Welcome to all the new faces including Roland Steinmetz from [Shared Visions](http://sharedvisions.ie/index.php), Michael Kane from [YouGetItBack](http://www.yougetitback.com), David McCarthy from [HTC](http://www.htc.com/), CiarÃ¡n Rooney from [Weeno](http://www.weeno.ie/) and Alexander Skeaping who is involved in the piano and harpsichord business! Aileen Cussen from Enterprise Ireland also attended. There was a distinct "mobile tech" feel to the meetup between Cubic, HTC, Lukulu, YouGetItBack and the 3 Nokia N95-8GBs and two different HTC devices on view.

I'll do separate posts on the upcoming meetups but in summary they are:



	  * Feb 22nd - Rubicon Center in CIT. Demo by Shared Visions
	  * March 7th - [CIX](http://www.cix.ie/) in Hollyhill. Demo of CIX by Tom Raftery

Pat suggested[ in his blog post](http://blog.roam4free.ie/cork-open-coffee/) about last Friday that we should have some elevator pitches at each session. Basically a longer version of the intros that we currently do. I think it's a great idea. How about 120 secs each for 2 or 3 people each week?
