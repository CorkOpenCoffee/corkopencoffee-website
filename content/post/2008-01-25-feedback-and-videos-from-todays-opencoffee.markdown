	  * A big thank you again to Catherine in [it@cork](http://itcork.ie) for making today happen, it was a superb session

	  * The recordings I did today of Brian McAuliffe presenting [Something.ie](http://www.something.ie/) were actually being streamed live to the web on [Qik.com](http://www.qik.com). The full set of videos from today can [be found here](http://qik.com/streams/browse?sort=ratings&tag=something.ie).
	  * The feedback on today was all positive with the only comment being that we should time-limit the demos (this is no reflection on Brian!). Perhaps we should just do 15 mins talk + 15 mins Q&A or just 30mins combined?
	  * We didn't get to talk about outsourcing which was a pity, hopefully next time.
	  * It was great to see so many new faces. I need to get their email addresses.
	  * Well done to Brendan from [Tapasol](http://www.tapasol.com) for winning a FON router which was kindly donated by [Tom Raftery](http://tomrafteryit.net/)
	  * It looks like Phoebe Bright will present at the next session on issues around energy. We are aiming for Webworks and will let you know when it is confirmed.
	  * Congratulations to Siasy for launching the all-new [EuropeanIrish.com](http://EuropeanIrish.com) -Let all your friends and family on the continent know about the site, it's a fantastic resource
