Welcome to the **Cork OpenCoffee Archive**. OCC was a regular tech meetup held in various cafes and startup-related venues around Cork Ireland from March 2007 until October 2015. At one point it was the most successful and well-attended OpenCoffee Club in Ireland. 

It followed in the footsteps of the Dublin OpenCoffee and Limerick OpenCoffee meetups. All of us were inspired by the original [OpenCoffee Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCoffee_Club) in London, created by Saul Klein.

This site is a static archive of [all the blogposts](/post) from August 2007 until March 2014 when it was shut down. Conor O'Neill, the original organiser of OCC, setup this archive in September 2021 for posterity.

You can find some other posts about OCC, particularly [the initial announcement](https://argolon.com/2007/03/11/cork-opencoffee-club-announcement/) etc, over on the [Argolon Blog](https://argolon.com/blog/).
