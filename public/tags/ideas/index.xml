      <description>This is an excellent opportunity for brand new business ideas. A new programme called &amp;lsquo;Discovery Zone&amp;rsquo; has been set up in the Rubicon Centre, the host of many Cork Open Coffees.
If you are among the many that aspire to starting your own business but don’t know where to start, then the Discovery Zone could be just the launching pad you need. The programme has been specifically developed to assist experienced professionals, who for a variety of reasons find themselves at a crossroads in their career.</description>
