Hi Occers,

Just before Christmas we experimented with an evening version of Open Coffee we affectionately called 'After Dark', the name seems to have stuck.

This coming Friday the 26th we're having another After Dark at 8pm in The Bodega, Cornmarket Street in Cork ([Map here](http://www.bodegacork.ie/contact-bodega-pub.aspx)).

It’s a great opportunity to attend Open Coffee and meet other members who can’t break away during work hours. It’s also a great excuse to grab a beer. We'll be having these After Dark meetings on the last Friday of each month.

So if you're free after work this Friday evening, call in and join us if you can. Look for the group of people with plenty of mobile phones and possibly laptops since there’s free Wi-fi in the Bodega. The last time, we gathered together just inside the door on the left in a little cubbyhole section.

Talk to you all on Friday,

Conor, Ciara & Gordon

Cork Open Coffee Organisers.
